   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20001"></a>First stab: second meditation</h4>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >A bit of background will be useful: Descartes has started the project of doubting everything he knew until
the time he wrote the Meditations and is now trying to find out if he can know anything with certainty. He
says:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >I will suppose then, that everything I see is spurious. I will believe that my memory tells
     me lies, and that none of the things that it reports ever happened. I have no senses. Body,
     shape, extension, movement and place are chimeras. So what remains true? (Meditation
     2, p. 17)</div>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >He presents the following argument that at least he can convince himself with full certainty that he exists. He
reasons as follows: if I can think of something, that means that I must exist, but right know I am thinking
(doubting, etc.), so I must exist, and as long as I am thinking something, I can rest assured of my own
existence.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   Suppose that you are in Descartes&#8217; position, and you have now convinced yourself that you can be
certain of your own existence. Now you can inquire into the nature of the thing whose existence you have
discovered (i.e. yourself). Since we have decided to doubt everything of which we are not certain, and we
are not certain that we have bodies, we may be tempted to conclude that the substance we are after (the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">I</span>
whose existence we have argued for) is not a body! <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>Is this a good argument? Can
you find a place where Descartes addresses this question? If so, what does he think about this
argument?
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Descartes continues his investigation about the nature of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">I </span>he just discovered. He adds that
just like he can&#8217;t doubt his own existence, he can&#8217;t doubt that he <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">really </span>is thinking when he
thinks that he is thinking, or that he really is doubting when he thinks that he is doubting, and
similarly for his other mental states, including the claim that he certainly seems to see and to
have other sensory perceptions, even if in fact those sensory perceptions don&#8217;t really track
anything.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   He argues that &#8220;even bodies are not strictly perceived by the senses or the faculty of imagination but by
the intellect alone". His argument for this claim is not particularly relevant for our purposes, but it would be
a good exercise to attempt to reconstruct his argument.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30001"></a>A conceivability argument: sixth meditation</h4>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >In his second meditation, Descartes presents a tentative argument that he is distinct from his body, but he
ends up rejecting it. Now he presents a stronger argument, which he fully endorses. He begins with the
premise that anything one can conceive without contradiction is possible:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >There  is  no  doubt  that  God  is  capable  of  creating  everything  that  I  am  capable  of
     perceiving in this manner; and I have never judged that something could not be made
     by him except on the grounds that there would be a contradiction in my perceiving it
     distinctly. (p. 50)<br 
class="newline" /></div>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >In p. 54, after presenting this assumption, he presents the rest of the argument:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >I know that everything which I clearly and distinctly understand is capable of being
     created by God so as to correspond exactly with my understanding of it. Hence the
     fact that I can clearly and distinctly understand one thing apart from another is enough
     to make me certain that the two things are distinct, since they are capable of being
     separated [...] Thus, simply by knowing that I exist and seeing at the same time that
     absolutely nothing else belongs to my nature or essence except that I am a thinking
     thing, I can infer correctly that my essence consists solely in the fact that I am a thinking
     thing. [...] on the one hand I have a clear and distinct idea of myself, in so far as I am
     simply a thinking, non-extended thing; and on the other hand I have a distinct idea of
     body, in so far as this is simply an extended, non-thinking thing. And accordingly, it is
     certain that I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it.(p. 54)</div>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >We can reconstruct Descartes&#8217; argument as follows:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Everything that I can conceive clearly, distinctly, and without contradiction, is possible.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Thus, if I can conceive that something exists without something else, then it must be possible
     for the former to exist without the latter.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">I can conceive of myself as a thinking thing, existing without my body.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   4. </dt><dd

     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   5. </dt><dd

   6. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem"><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">I am really distinct from my body, and can exist without it.</span></dd></dl>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >One way of understanding the argument is by appeal to the following premise:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Necessity of identity:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">if A and B are the same thing, then <span

<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Given premise 5 of the argument, 6 follows by modus tollens.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Another way to arrive to the conclusion is by means of Leibniz&#8217;s law, explained below.<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Once
you read the part about Leibniz&#8217;s law, how can we reconstruct Descartes&#8217; argument so that it makes explicit
use of it?
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40001"></a>An argument for dualism using Leibniz&#8217;s law (sixth meditation)</h4>
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Some pages after stating the previous argument, Descartes introduces some further reasons to think that the
mind is different from the body, even though he takes his argument from conceivability to have established
this. His new argument appeals to the following principle:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Leibniz&#8217;s law:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">If  A  and  B  are  the  same  thing,  then  they  must  have  all  the  same  properties.
     Equivalently, If A and B differ in at least one property, then they are not the same thing.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Leibniz was not the first person to use this principle in an argument, since Descartes used it before in the
following argument:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >there is a great difference between the mind and the body, inasmuch as the body is by
     its nature always divisible, while the mind is utterly indivisible [...] This one argument
     would be enough to show me that the mind is completely different from the body, even
     if I did not already know as much from other considerations. (p. 59)</div>
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Using Leibniz&#8217;s law, we can reconstruct the argument as follows:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If A and B differ in at least one property, then they are not the same thing (LeibnizÂ&#x0165;s law).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The mind is always divisible.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd

   4. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem"><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">The mind is not the body.</span></dd></dl>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>What do you think about this argument? Can you think of other arguments for dualism that use
Leibniz&#8217;s law? Is Leibniz&#8217;s law an implicit premise in Descartes&#8217; argument from conceivability? Can we
use any property to make an argument for distinctness using LeibnizÂ&#x0165;s law?

   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002"></a>Descartes&#8217; dualism</h1>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Descartes&#8217; view about the nature of the mind is usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">substance dualism</span>. It is so called because
it posits two kinds of substances: mental and material&#8212;or physical, as we would now call
them.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
 id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5001f1"></a>
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Descartes&#8217; dualism attempts to recover the common sense intuition that our minds interact with
our bodies: our mind can control our body at will, and our body can influence our minds by
producing in it pains, hunger, and other sensations including sense perception. For this reason,
Descartes&#8217; view is also a version of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">interactionist dualism</span>. The main tenet of interactionist
dualism is simply that, though the mind and the body are different kinds of substances, they can
interact with each other. The following remarks by Descartes show his commitment to this
view:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >      There is nothing that my own nature teaches more vividly than that I have a body,
     and that when I fell pain there is something wrong with the body, and that when I am
     hungry or thirsty the body needs food and drink, and so on. So I should not doubt that
     there is some truth in this (p. 56).<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >      I am not merely present in my body as a sailor is present in a ship, but ... I am very
     closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If
     this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the
     body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor
     perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken. (p. 56)</div>
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   Descartes&#8217; view was forcefully attacked since the very beginning, which is why we will consider some
objections raised by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003"></a>Elisabeth&#8217;s challenges</h1>
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Recall Descartes&#8217; working definition of a body:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >By a body I understand whatever has a determinable shape and a definable location and
     can occupy a spas: in such a way as to exclude any other body; it can be perceived by
     touch, sight, hearing, taste or smell, and can be moved in various ways, not by itself but
     by whatever else comes into contact with it. (p. 17)</div>
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, Descartes has argued that he (his soul, his mind) can exist without a body, and without having any
extension. This is what puzzles Elisabeth:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >Given that the soul of a human being is only a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">thinking </span>substance, how can it affect the
     bodily spirits, in order to bring about voluntary actions? The question arises because
     it seems that how a thing moves depends solely on (i) how much it is pushed, (ii) the
     manner in which it is pushed, or (iii) the surface-texture and shape of the thing that
     pushes it. The first two of those require <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contact </span>between the two things, and the third
     requires  that  the  causally  active  thing  be  extended.  Your  notion  of  the  soul  entirely
     excludes extension, and it appears to me that an immaterial thing can&#8217;t possibly <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">touch</span>
     anything else. (Elisabeth to Descartes, 6.V.1643)</div>
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >Descartes has claimed that the mind and the body causally interact with each other, and Elisabeth is asking for
an explanation of how the interaction is supposed to obtain. Elisabeth challenges is as follows: causing a
material thing to move requires being extended, but Descartes claims that minds are not extended. So how
can minds cause bodies to move?
<!--l. 115--><p class="indent" >   In another letter, Elisabeth presses the challenge:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >      I&#8217;ve never been able to conceive of &#8216;what is immaterial&#8217; in any way except as the
     bare  negative  &#8216;what  is  not  material&#8217;,  and  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">that  </span>can&#8217;t  enter  into  causal  relations  with
     matter!<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 119--><p class="indent" >      I have to say that I would find it easier to concede matter and extension to the soul
     than to concede that an immaterial thing could move and be moved by a body. On the
     one side, if the soul moves the body through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">information</span>, the spirits would have to
     think, and you say that nothing of a bodily thing thinks. On the other side, you show
     in your <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Meditations </span>that the body could move the soul, and yet it is hard to understand
     that [...] a soul that can exist without the body, and that has nothing in common with
     the body, is so governed by it. (Elisabeth to Descartes 10.VI.1643)</div>

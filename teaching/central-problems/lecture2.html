<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   What is the good? How should we live our lives? These are two of the questions that Aristotle is
concerned with in the Nicomachean Ethics (abbreviated NE). Since his work has been so influential, we&#8217;ll
start by examining some parts of it. Later on we&#8217;ll transition into more recent answers to the same
questions, and compare them to Aristotle&#8217;s.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   A substantial portion of the first book of NE is devoted to the exposition of his own take on the question
what the good is. Crucially, Aristotle thinks that what is good for people is that which constitutes their
proper function, and that is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">happiness</span>. This by itself is not very illuminating, so we&#8217;ll go step by step. On
the way, this will help us exercise some basic skills for reading philosophical texts, which in turn will be
helpful when you write philosophy.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s start with the structure of the text. We can divide the first book in four different parts. First,
Aristotle presents a question&#8212;what is the good?&#8212;and briefly discusses some methodological
considerations for answering it. Second, he considers some possible answers to the question he is
concerned with that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">he doesn&#8217;t endorse </span>and tells us what is wrong with those answers. Third, he
presents his own answer to the question, and argues for it. Finally, he makes some remarks
about the consequences of his view and the puzzles that may arise from it, and introduces some
material that will elaborate his view in the second book. The present nodes consider the first two
points.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Framing the question: what is the good?</h1>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle starts with some intuitive considerations. First, he notes, every action, enquiry, craft, and decision
is performed in the pursuit of something. The thing pursued by an action is what he calls an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">end</span>, or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">good </span>that the action seeks. For instance, the end of the practice of medicine is the health of the patients, and
the end of carmaking is the finished car. Early on, Aristotle gives us a short argument to the effect that there
are multiple ends, rather than just one: &#8220;Since there are many actions, crafts, and sciences, the
ends turn out to be many as well&#8221;. The conclusion that there are many ends doesn&#8217;t follow
immediately from the premise that there are many actions but it will follow if we add an extra
premise (this kind of argument is what is called an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">enthymeme</span>). The resulting argument is
this:

     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There are many activities (i.e. actions, crafts, sciences, etc.).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Any two different activities must have different ends; therefore,
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There are many ends.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >However, though there are many different ends, Aristotle doesn&#8217;t think that they are all equally valuable or
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">choiceworthy</span>: we choose to pursue some ends merely for the sake of our pursuit of some further end, but
other ends we choose because they are valuable in themselves.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle thinks that ends which we don&#8217;t pursue for the sake of others are more valuable or
choiceworthy. If there is some end that we pursue just for itself, and for the sake of which we pursue all
other ends, then that should be the highest end, the best good, or the good for humans. When
Aristotle talks about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the good </span>without qualification, he is talking about that highest end, but this
shouldn&#8217;t be taken to mean that this is also the good for animals, plants, or for everything there is.
He calls it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the good </span>simpliciter because is the highest good that people should be concerned
with.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   So when Aristotle asks what the good is, he is asking about the highest good that humans should
pursue. This is also the highest good achievable in action: to reiterate, the good for the sake of which we do
everything we do, and which we don&#8217;t pursue for the sake of anything else. This clarifies a part of the
question about the nature of the good.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Before examining some answers to this question, Aristotle makes some important remarks about
methodology. The first is that we should only require as much precision and generality as the
subject matter allows. The second is that the end or goal of our enquiry is action, and not just
knowledge.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   With respect to the first, we should content ourselves with getting to know what holds <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">usually </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">for</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">most </span>people:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >[G]oods also vary in the same way, because they result in harm to many people&#8212;for
     some have been destroyed because of their wealth, others because of their bravery. And
     so, since this is our subject and these are our premises, we shall be satisfied to indicate
     the truth roughly and in outline; since our subject and our premises are things that hold
     good usually [but not universally], we shall be satisfied to draw conclusions of the same
     sort. (1094b17-23)</div>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle is saying that the facts about what is good for a person are not universal, since things that
are generally good for people (e.g. wealth and bravery) can in some cases be bad for certain
people. Thus, we shouldn&#8217;t expect that the study of the good will yield universal truths (truths
holding without exception), but only to discover what is true <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in general</span>. This ends Aristotle&#8217;s
framing of the question. Now let&#8217;s see what he thinks of some answers others have given before
him.

<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Some answers, with objections</h1>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle thinks that the highest good is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">happiness</span>. Indeed, he thinks that this is most people&#8217;s opinion.
However, our inquiry can&#8217;t end here: as Aristotle points out, different people take happiness to be different
things:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >Some take it [happiness] to be one thing, others another. Indeed, the same person often
     changes his mind; for when he has fallen ill, he thinks happiness is health, and when he
     has fallen in poverty, he thinks it is wealth [... Among the wise,] however, some used
     to think that besides these many goods there is some other good that exists in its own
     right and that causes all these goods to be goods. (1095a22 ff.)</div>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle wants to reject some of these conceptions of happiness. That is, he wants to reject the claim that
happiness is pleasure or gratification, that happiness is honor, and that happiness is some sort of thing that
exists in its own right, namely, the Idea of the good. He discusses pleasure more thoroughly later, in books
7 and 10.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle&#8217;s case against the claim that honor is the ultimate good is brief, but substantial. It relies on an
important distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Roughly, a property of an object is intrinsic
if the object has it merely in virtue of how it is by itself. Otherwise, the property is extrinsic.
For instance, suppose that John is a certain heigh, say, 6ft tall. The property of having that
height is usually taken to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">intrinsic</span>. Now suppose that John also has the property of being
taller than most people in a certain room. That is an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">extrinsic </span>property, because it depends
not only on John&#8217;s height, but also on the properties of people other than John, namely, their
heights.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a>
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle claims that honor can&#8217;t be the ultimate good. For honor depends on the judgments of other
people, whereas the ultimate good does not. In other words, honor is had <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">extrinsically</span>, whereas the ultimate
good is had <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">intrinsically</span>:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >This [i.e. honor], however, appears to be too superficial to be what we are seeking, for
     it seems to depend more on those who honor than on the one honored, whereas we
     intuitively believe that the good is something of our own and hard to take from us.
     (1095b24)</div>
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s now consider the view that the good is something that exists in its own right. Let&#8217;s call that thing
which exists in its own right <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the Idea of the good</span>, and the view that the good is that idea of the good the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Platonic View</span>. Aristotle offers several arguments against this view. The first is somewhat complicated, but
very interesting. Unfortunately, examining it in all detail would take us too far afield. So let&#8217;s consider the
other ones.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s start with these remarks:
     <div class="quote">

     <!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >Further, good is spoken of in as many ways as being [is spoken of]: in what it is, as god
     and mind; in quality, as the virtues; in quantity, as the measured amount; in relative,
     as the useful [...] Hence it is clear that the good cannot be some common and single
     universal; for if it were, it would be spoken of in only one [of the types of] predication,
     not in them all.</div>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >As Terence Irwin points out, Aristotle thought that the most general answer to the question what a thing is, is
given by pointing out the category to which it belongs. Among other categories, Aristotle considered
substance, quality, and quantity.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle didn&#8217;t think that any two things in different categories could be subsumed under a more
general classification. This is why he thinks there can&#8217;t be a single property (we&#8217;ll be assuming that by
&#8220;universal&#8221; he just means <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">property</span>) that is shared by all the things that are good: corresponding to each
category, there is a thing that is the good in that category, but since the different categories can&#8217;t be
themselves subsumed under a more general class, he thinks that the goods corresponding to the different
categories can&#8217;t be so subsumed either. In Irwin&#8217;s words, &#8220;since the goodness of any thing depends on the
kind of thing it is, goodness can be no more a unified property than being is." (Note to book 1, ch. 6,
?3).
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Here is another argument to reject the Platonic view:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >Further, if a number of things have a single Idea, there is also a single science of them;
     hence [if there were an Idea of good] there would also be some science of all goods.
     But, in fact, there are many sciences even of the goods under one [type of] predication.
     [... Hence there is no science of the good, and so no Idea]. (1096a30)</div>
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>Do you think this is a good argument? Why?
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>The human good</h1>
<!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle has given us some reasons to reject the previews answers to his main question. Now
he is going to present his own view. He starts by presenting some criteria that the good must
satisfy:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">The good is the ultimate end. Aristotle thinks that if there is a good (an end) for each action,
     that end must be that for the sake of which the action is performed. Since we are looking for
     the good in action <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in general</span>, the good must be the end for the sake of which we perform
     all other actions; that is, the good (or goods, since he hasn&#8217;t proved that there is only one)
     achievable in action.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The good is complete. According to Aristotle, an end that is pursued in its own right is more
     complete than an end pursued because of something else. An end that is always pursued in its
     own right is complete without qualification. It seems natural to think that the ultimate good
     must be complete in this sense.

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The good is self-sufficient. Something is self-sufficient in Aristotle&#8217;s sense when &#8220;all by itself
     makes a life choiceworthy and lacking nothing&#8221; (1097b15).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">The good is that which is most choice worthy of all goods, and not just considered to be a
     good among many.</li></ul>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle thinks that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">happiness </span>satisfies all these criteria. As we&#8217;ll see, he thinks this result matches well with
some common opinions. However, his answer to the question what the good is doesn&#8217;t end here. For people
have different opinions as to what happiness amounts to.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   Next, Aristotle will offer a theory of the good. Aristotle has offered some reason to think that the
human good is happiness. Now he will try to explain in virtue of what happiness is the human
good.
   <div class="footnotes"><!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >      <span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   We have been talking about Frege&#8217;s puzzles of cognitive value and attitude ascriptions. As it should be
clear from Kripke&#8217;s numerous objections to Frege and Russell&#8217;s promising theories, it&#8217;s not clear how
exactly the puzzles are to be solved. Given Kripke&#8217;s objections, Frege&#8217;s puzzles took a significant amount
of attention in the last three decades. Numerous attempts to solve them sprung, but to this center, none of
them has come to be widely accepted. Moreover, the solutions are often quite technical, and understanding
them requires a significant amount of familiarity with formal tools that we won&#8217;t present in
class.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   So instead of introducing a new view, we&#8217;ll briefly discuss a similar problem, raised originally by
Héctor Neri-Castaneda, and made prominent by John Perry. Perry calls it &#8220;the problem of the essential
indexical&#8221;. When you read Perry&#8217;s paper and these notes, it will be convenient to keep this question in
mind: is this the same problem as Frege&#8217;s puzzle of cognitive significance? If not, how is it
different?
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>The problem of the essential indexical</h1>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Perry considers the following three cases:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Sugar:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Perry is walking around the supermarket, when he spots a trail of sugar. He says to himself
     &#8216;The shopper with a torn sack is making a mess&#8217;, and believes that the shopper with a torn
     sack is making a mess. Later on, he realizes that he is the shopper with a torn sack, and now
     he says to himself &#8216;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">I </span>am the shopper with a torn sack, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">I </span>am making a mess&#8217;. He now believes
     that he is making a mess, and since he is a responsible person, he fixes the sack of sugar in
     his cart, so that he stops making a mess.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Adventure:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">An adventurer is in the forest, looking for the Mt. Tallac trail. He knows that the trail
     is next to Gilmore lake. If he were asked where the Mt. Tallac trail is, he would say &#8216;the Mt.
     Tallac trail is next to Gilmore lake&#8217;. Unbeknownst to our adventurer, he is standing right on
     the Mt. Tallac trail, and the lake next to him is Gilmore lake. After a while of looking at the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     map and his surroundings, he realizes this. He says to himself &#8216;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">This </span>is the Mt. Tallac trail, and
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">that </span>lake next to me is Gilmore Lake&#8217;. Having acquired this new belief, he continues to walk
     on the trail, relieved not to be lost anymore.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Meeting:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">A professor who works on indexicals knows that he has a meeting at noon. However,
     he has lost track of time while working on his research and, at noon, he hasn&#8217;t gone to the
     meeting yet. At noon, he still continues to remind himself that he has a meeting at noon.
     Suddenly, he realizes that he is late for his meeting. He tells himself &#8216;I have a meeting <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">now</span>&#8217;
     or &#8216;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">now </span>is noon!&#8217; All along, he believed that he had a meeting at noon; what he suddenly
     realized and now believes is that he has a meeting now.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >According to Perry, what is interesting about these cases is that, in each of them, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">indexicals </span>we use in the
attribution of the second of their beliefs is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">essential </span>to the attribution: replacing the indexical with a
different word, even if it has the same referent, no longer seems to express the same thing. One piece of
evidence for this is that once we substitute a different expression for the indexical, the belief attribution no
longer seems to be explanatory.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   For instance, Perry knew all along that the shopper with the torn bag was making a mess. What he
didn&#8217;t know was that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">he </span>was the one making a mess. He could have been repeating to himself &#8216;The shopper
with the torn bag was making a mess&#8217;, but he hadn&#8217;t told himself &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217;. His belief
that the shopper with the torn bag was making a mess didn&#8217;t make him stop and rearrange
his sugar bag. It was only the belief that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">he </span>was making a mess that explains why he stopped
and rearranged his bag. But <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">he </span>was the shopper with the torn bag. So even though the two
expressions denote the same thing in this case, one can&#8217;t be substituted for the other while
retaining explanatory power, nor can they be substituted <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">salva veritate </span>in the context of a belief
attribution.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   As you may have noticed, indexicals are words like &#8216;I&#8217;, &#8216;he&#8217;, &#8216;now&#8217;, and &#8216;here&#8217;. What is interesting
about these words is that, unlike proper names, they don&#8217;t denote the same thing independently of the
context. Rather, they only denote some thing or other in context. If I say &#8216;I like apples&#8217; &#8216;I&#8217; refers to me, but
if you say the same sentence, &#8216;I&#8217; refers to you. Similarly, if I say &#8216;My computer is on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">now</span>&#8217;, &#8216;now&#8217; refers to a
particular time: August 4 at noon. If I say that same sentence at a different time, &#8216;now&#8217; will refer to another
time.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   In the cases above, it seems like the indexical can&#8217;t be replaced by a term with the same referent in a
way that preserves the explanatory force of the original statement. This is why, in that sense, the use of an
indexical seems to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">essential </span>to the explanatory force of the statements that include it (in the cases
above). This is what Perry calls the problem of the essential indexical.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Before proceeding to his discussion of some possible solutions, let&#8217;s introduce a bit of useful
terminology. In our discussion of Russell&#8217;s theory of definite descriptions, we introduced a distinction
between two kinds of attributions of beliefs or other attitudes: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>(about the thing) and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de dicto </span>(about
what is said). We might as well introduce a new term for the kind of attributions that essentially involve
indexicals. Let&#8217;s call such attributions <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de se </span>(of oneself). Perry&#8217;s discussion then has to do with the right
analysis of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de se </span>belief attributions.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   The reports that essentially involved indexicals in the cases we called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Sugar, Adventure, and</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Meeting </span>above are all De Se. Perry calls the beliefs that are reported by de se reports <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">locating</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">beliefs</span>.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   According to Perry, de se belief reports and locating beliefs are problematic for a certain
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
kind of view about propositions usually associated with Frege. Call it the <span

   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>The problem for the Fregean view</h1>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >Is there a proposition that the people in our cases above come to believe and satisfies the identity
conditions of the Fregean theory of propositions? Perry doesn&#8217;t think so. To some extent, his
argument seems to rely on a certain way of understanding the way in which indexicals work. He
says:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >the  sentence  by  which  I  identify  what  I  came  to  believe  doesn&#8217;t  identify,  by  itself,
     a proposition. There is a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">missing conceptual ingredient</span>: a sense for which I am the
     refference, or a complex of properties I alone have, or a singular term that refers to no
     one but me. (p. 7)</div>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >What he means is that the word &#8216;I&#8217;, unlike the word &#8216;Martín&#8217; or the description &#8216;the teacher of Central
Problems&#8217;, doesn&#8217;t seem to determine a referent just by itself. This is why, in some occasions, it
can refer to me, but in some others to you or someone else, depending on who the speaker
is.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Even if Perry is right that the sentence &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217;, say, doesn&#8217;t by itself determine a
proposition, this fact is hardly remarkable. For even if we had used a description, the sentence may have
failed to determine a proposition just by itself. When we use quantifiers or definite descriptions, we often
assume that some domain of quantification is in place. But nothing in the sentence says anything about the
domain of quantification.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   More or less around the time Perry published his paper, another paper by David Kaplan had
undergone unofficial circulation. That paper (&#8220;Demonstratives&#8221;) laid the foundations for a theory of
indexical and other context-sensitive expressions. We won&#8217;t examine Kaplan&#8217;s view in all detail.
Suffice it to say that, on his view, an indexical term like &#8216;I&#8217; has a denotation only relative to a
context. In particular &#8216;I&#8217; denotes the person who speaks in the context in which the word is
used.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   Kaplan&#8217;s view is widely accepted. So even if Perry is right that the &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217; by itself
doesn&#8217;t determine a proposition, a defender of the Fregean theory of propositions can offer an easy reply:
perhaps the sentence doesn&#8217;t determine a proposition by itself, but in any context in which it is used, that
sentence <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">does </span>determine a referent.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   However, this doesn&#8217;t help to solve the real problem for the Fregean view of propositions.
Recall Frege&#8217;s solution to the puzzle about attitude ascriptions: he thought that the sentence
embedded in a that-clause referred to its customary sense. So in the sentence &#8216;I believe that I am
making a mess&#8217;, &#8216;that I am making a mess&#8217; should refer to such customary sense (the proposition
expressed by &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217;). Perry thinks that this Fregean view won&#8217;t be enough to
explain the difference in content between &#8216;I believe that the shopper with a torn bag is making a
mess&#8217; and &#8216;I believe that I am making a mess&#8217; when the user of these sentences is Perry, and
absent a belief that Perry would express by means of the sentence &#8216;I am the shopper with a torn
bag&#8217;.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   The reason is this. Suppose, for the sake of the argument, that on any given use of the sentence, there is
a concept associated with the word &#8216;I&#8217;. In particular, when Perry is in the supermarket and says to himself &#8216;I
am making a mess&#8217;, he associates some sense or mode of presentation with the word &#8216;I&#8217;. Now, either
this sense is a description involving an indexical, or it is not. If it involves an indexical, then
we are just in the starting position again, so this option just takes us back in a circle. If the
description does not involve an indexical, then there should be a concept <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">d </span>such that when
Perry says &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217;, he means <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the thing that is d is making a mess</span>. Now there are
two problems: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">first</span>, in order for a belief in that proposition to explain why Perry fixed his
bag, Perry must also believe that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">he </span>is the person that is <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">d</span>&#8212;which seems to take us back to
our starting point. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Second</span>, it must be that Perry is indeed the person that is <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">d</span>, but we don&#8217;t
always have a reason to think that this is so. Suppose, for instance, that Perry self-identifies as
the smartest person in the room. Unbeknownst to him, Kit Fine is also in the room, so as it
happens, Perry is not the smartest person in the room. But then the second condition fails,
and so, the difference between the indexical and the non-indexical description has been left
unexplained.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   At this point, Perry stops considering the Fregean view of propositions and examines some other
explanations.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>De Re beliefs</h1>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Recall Russell&#8217;s distinction between de dicto and de re occurrences of a quantifier. When we introduced
the distinction, we used something like the locution &#8220;believing of x&#8221; to signal that we were
making an attribution de re. Let&#8217;s continue to speak that way. Let someone S believe <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of x </span>that she
has such and such property just in case there is a definite description such that x <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in fact </span>is the
unique satisfier of that description and S believes that the satisfier of the description is so and
so.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   For instance, since Aristotle is in fact the center of the Nicomachean Ethics, Tim can believe <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of</span>
Aristotle that he was smart as long as he believes that the center of the Nicomachean Ethics is smart. How
can this definition help solve Perry&#8217;s problem? We can readily see that it won&#8217;t. For suppose that
Perry believes <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of Perry </span>that he is making a mess. The attribution of such belief won&#8217;t do the
explanatory work that we would expect. For there is no difference between the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>attribution
of the beliefs that the shopper with the torn sack is making a mess and that I am making a
mess. The De Re readings of these two attributions are exactly the same. So we still lack an
explanation of how one of them can move Perry to rearrange his bag of sugar, but the other
doesn&#8217;t.

   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40004"></a>Relativized propositions</h1>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s time for a bit more of terminology. Many traditions have stemmed from the writings of Frege,
Russell, and Kripke, together with other prominent philosophers. In particular, during the 60s
and 70s many linguists started using the technical resources developed by philosophers at the
time. One very prominent such resource was Kripke&#8217;s possible worlds semantics for modal
logic.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Kripke developed a way of formally determining the truth conditions for statements involving operators
such as &#8216;necessarily&#8217; and &#8216;possibly&#8217;. In particular, he assimilated these operators to quantifiers whose
domain was a set of possible worlds (formally, a set of points). There are many different interpretations of
Kripke&#8217;s formal apparatus, but the one he preferred was the following: a possible world is something like a
story about how things could have been. Presumably, there are infinitely many ways that things could have
been: cats could have been blue, there could have been only one object in the universe, people could
have never existed, etc. For each of those ways that things could have been, there is a possible
world.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   In Kripke&#8217;s semantics, to say that something is necessarily true is to say that it is true in <span

Philosophers were very impressed with possible world semantics. So impressed, in fact, that they and some
linguists started using it to study ordinary language.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   From the work on possible world semantics stemmed a new way of thinking about propositions.
Russell thought of them as structured entities, in which objects and properties could figure as parts; the
Fregean theory of propositions sees them as things made of concepts. The new view of propositions,
inspired by Kripke&#8217;s treatment, sees propositions as sets of possible worlds, namely, the set of possible
worlds in which the proposition is true.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   On that new conception (call it the possible world conception of propositions), a proposition is never
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
true or false <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">simpliciter</span>. Instead, it is only true or false relative to a certain world with respect to which it is
evaluated. However, we pointed out that sentences involving indexicals only had definite truth values
relative to a context. This can mean either of two things: that the proposition expressed by the sentence is
determined by a context, but once the sentence is determined, it is true or false only relative to a possible
world; or it could mean that the very truth or falsity is relative to a context. The latter captures the view that
Perry is now considering.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   On this view, a sentence like &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217; is true only relative to a pair consisting of a possible
world and a person. The latter will be the value of &#8216;I&#8217;. The considerations involving this kind of view are
many and subtle, and a proper evaluation of this view could require an entire seminar by itself, so for the
time being let&#8217;s rest content with stating Perry&#8217;s objection.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   His objection is something like this. In order for a belief in this relativized proposition (that I
am making a mess) to explain Perry&#8217;s behavior of rearranging the sugar bag in his cart, Perry
must not only have the belief in the relativized proposition, but he also must believe that he is
the person relative to which the proposition is being evaluated. Moreover, he must believe it
in a special way that involves Perry&#8217;s telling to himself something like &#8216;I am the person to
which &#8216;I&#8217; refers&#8217;, or something like that. If he merely believed that &#8216;I am making a mess&#8217; is true
relative to Perry, that wouldn&#8217;t help unless he knew that he was Perry. But then again, such
belief seems to contain an indexical element. So it seems that the new strategy doesn&#8217;t quite
help.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   So what&#8217;s the right view, then? Well, what indeed. Perry thinks that we should reject the idea that our
belief states should be classified by the proposition one believes. But of course, this is just a picture for how
a good theory might look. It is not a theory by itself.

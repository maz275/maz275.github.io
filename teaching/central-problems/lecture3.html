<h1 class="center">3. Aristotle&#8217;s account of the good</h1>

<div class="center" ><span 
class="ptmr8t-x-x-120">July 8, 2015</span></div>
   </div>         We have considered some answers to the question what is the good, and Aristotle&#8217;s objections to
those answers. We have also seen that, according to Aristotle, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">happiness </span>is the ultimate human good, but we
are still missing a theory of the good. This theory should, at least in part, explain what happiness is, and
why happiness turns out to be the human good. Now it&#8217;s time to examine Aristotle&#8217;s views on the
matter.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>The function argument</h1>
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle believes that the good for humans is that which best fulfills the function of humans. He seems to
think that the function of a kind of thing is some goal-directed activity such that it is essential to that thing
to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">aim </span>at performing that activity, insofar as it belongs to that kind. For instance, insofar as someone is a
painter, it seems essential to her to aim to paint, and so, Aristotle would say that the function of a painter is
to paint. Inanimate objects may have functions too. Consider a piston: one could think that insofar as
something is a piston, it is essential to it to aim to transfer force, and so, that the function of a piston is to
transfer force.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   This definition can use some clarification. We&#8217;ll say that an object has a certain property <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">essentially </span>(or,
alternatively, that that property is essential to an object) if the object couldn&#8217;t have existed without having
it. Philosophers disagree as to which properties are essential to which objects, but here are some standard
examples. According to Saul Kripke (a prominent philosopher), it is essential to a person to have the
parents that she actually has. Consider Anna, whose parents are Tom and Mary. If Tom and Mary hadn&#8217;t
had a child, then Anna would have existed. Perhaps there could have been people with lives very
similar to the life that Anna actually had. Perhaps they would have even looked exactly like
Anna, but as long as their parents weren&#8217;t Tom and Mary, all those people wouldn&#8217;t have been
Anna.
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   Our definition of essential properties doesn&#8217;t entail that if a property is essential to Anna, then it is
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">enough </span>for something to be Anna that it has that property. In other words, having the essential property is
just a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">necessary </span>condition for being Anna, but it is not <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">sufficient</span>. Similarly, even if it&#8217;s true that it is
essential to a painter (insofar as she is a painter) to aim to paint, that doesn&#8217;t entail that painting is
sufficient to be a painter (perhaps one also needs to have proper technique, know about art history,
etc.).

<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately, our clarification can&#8217;t go much further than that. We still don&#8217;t have a clear idea of what
it is to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">aim </span>to perform a certain activity, but hopefully we have a clear enough conception of that for our
present purposes. As we said above, Aristotle thinks that the human good is that which best fulfills the
human function.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   He presents a brief argument for this claim in ?10:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps then, we shall find this [a clearer statement of what the good is] if we first
     grasp  the  function  of  a  human  being.  For  just  as  the  good,  i.e.,  [doing]  well,  for  a
     flautist, a sculptor, every craftsman, and, in general, for whatever has a function and a
     [characteristic] function, seems to depend on its function, the same seems to be true for
     a human being, if a human being has a function. (1097b25)</div>
<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Aristotle is saying that the function of a thing determines what its good is. If something has a particular
function, the good of that thing is to fulfill that function well. For instance, a good flautist is one who
plays the flute well, and a good piston is one that transfers force well. Moreover, the good of
a flautist <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">insofar as she is a flautist </span>is to be a good flautist, and similarly for other kinds fo
things. So if human beings have a function, the human good must be to fulfill that function
well.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Next, Aristotle offers a brief inductive argument to the effect that human beings in fact have a
function: &#8220;Or, just as eye, hand, foot, and, in general, every [bodily] part apparently has its
function, may we likewise ascribe to a human being some function apart from all of these?&#8221;
(1097b30).<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>
This, together with the previous claim, yields the conclusion that the human good is determined by the
human function.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   We can reconstruct Aristotle&#8217;s argument as follows:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">For each kind of thing that has a function, the good of that thing (insofar as it belongs to that
     kind) is to fulfill its function well. [assumption]
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Thus, if human beings have functions, then the good of human beings is to fulfill that function
     well. [this follows directly from (1), by universal instantiation]
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The bodily parts that constitute a human have functions. [assumption]
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (4) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">So humans too have functions. [by induction from (3)]
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (5) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">So the good of human beings is to fulfill their function well. [from (2) and (4), by modus
     ponens]</dd></dl>

<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >The step from (3) to (4) may seem a bit mysterious. If Aristotle offers any argument at all, it must be a sort of
inductive argument. If things 1, 2, 3, ... <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n </span>have property P, then so must thing <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">m</span>, since it is similar in
the relevant respects to things 1, 2, 3, ... <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">n</span>. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>Do you think the step from (3) to (4)
is in good standing? How is a human being similar to a painter, a harpist, or a bodily part,
in the ways that are relevant to the argument? Moreover, why should we think that if human
beings have a function, they must have <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exactly </span>one function? Couldn&#8217;t human beings have
many functions insofar as they are human beings? If so, how should we define the good for a
human?
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   By a process of elimination, Aristotle concludes that the human function is &#8220;the activity of the soul in
accord with reason or requiring reason&#8221; (1098a7). Ultimately, Aristotle wants to defend the following
view:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Aristotle&#8217;s view of the good:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The highest human good is the activity of the soul (i.e. the mind) in
     accordance with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">virtue </span>over the course of a person&#8217;s life.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1007f2"></a></dd></dl>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s see how he arrived at that conclusion.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle seems to think that, for every kind, an <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">excellent </span>member of that kind is one who performs the
function of that kind in an excellent way. From this and the thesis that the function of humans is the activity
of the mind or the soul in accordance with reason, he concludes that the function of humans is to excel at
the actions of the mind in accordance with reason. Being someone who so excels is the highest good that
someone can aspire to, insofar as she is a person.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   What does that have to do with virtue? Aristotle thinks that each function is performed well
(excellently) by being performed in accordance with the virtue proper to that kind of function.
So if the human good is to excel at the actions of the mind in accordance with reason, that
good is to be achieved in accordance with a certain virtue. Finally, Aristotle thinks that such
virtue must be the best and the most complete that people can aspire to have, in the sense that it
must be a virtue that includes all other virtues that people can have and are relevant to the
fulfillment of the human function, e.g. a virtue that includes bravery, generosity, temperance,
etc.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   This gives us a clearer idea of Aristotle&#8217;s view, but there are still many questions he hasn&#8217;t
answered: what is virtue, and what is a life in accordance with virtue? Why should we think
that a happy life is a life in accordance with virtue? How can we achieve the highest good,
namely, a life in accordance with virtue? We&#8217;ll now consider some of his answers to these
questions.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Aristotle&#8217;s defense of his account of the good</h1>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Before, Aristotle had agreed with the common opinion that the human good was happiness. Now he argues
that this hypothesis matches the account of the good that he just offered. He does this by arguing that
happiness understood as activity in accordance with virtue fits well with certain opinions held by his
contemporaries:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Aristotle&#8217;s view agrees to some extent with the view that happiness is either virtue in general

     or  some  particular  virtue,  since  according  to  Aristotle  happiness  requires  the  exercise  of
     virtue. However, no virtue by itself (nor virtue in general) is identical to happiness: happiness
     requires <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">acting </span>with accordance with virtue, and not merely possessing the virtue. Someone
     who was virtuous but never acted would not be happy, according to Aristotle.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f3"></a>
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Some people think that happiness must involve pleasure, in that someone who is happy must
     experience pleasure. Aristotle thinks that his view can also account for this opinion: he thinks
     that actions in accordance with virtue are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">pleasant by nature </span>or pleasant in themselves. So
     someone who acts in accordance with virtue will be pleased by her own actions. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question:</span>
     Do you think that actions in accordance with virtue are pleasant in themselves? Compare
     them with actions that are pleasant to some but not all people, e.g. playing golf. Can you think
     of an example of another thing that is pleasant in itself?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Happiness also needs external goods. Aristotle held that a person lacking in beauty or who
     wasn&#8217;t born in a rich family could not be happy. Accordingly, he thought that such a person
     could not regularly act in accordance with virtue. This particular view seems false, but there
     seems to be some truth to the claim that happiness requires some external goods. Can you
     think of examples of those external things?</li></ul>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Happiness and Virtue</h1>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >We are now at a very important point. We have discussed many theoretical considerations in favor of
Aristotle&#8217;s views, and we have examined the question what is the good from a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysical </span>perspective.
However, Aristotle himself pointed out that our current study is not so much concerned with knowledge of
facts as it is concerned with actions. This is what concerns us now. Before, and mostly as a preliminary, he
was asking what the highest good is; now he is asking how we should live, how to be virtuous, how to be
happy.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle thinks that most of us can be happy, and in fact that happiness can be &#8220;cultivated&#8221; or
acquired by means of some sort of learning process. Not everyone can be happy because not
everyone will be in the conditions that would allow her to cultivate virtue and perform virtuous
actions.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   As we already saw, Aristotle may be thinking of people who are not wealthy or beautiful, but we can
formulate a more reasonable version of his point. Think of a person who only sees violent and non-virtuous
actions since childhood. Perhaps his parents beat him, his teachers in school are not very interested in their
jobs, and the rest of the children in his school are in similar circumstances. If most of the actions this
person sees early on are violent and non-virtuous actions, it&#8217;s very unlikely that this person will come to
learn to be virtuous. Based on which examples could he learn to be virtuous, and how could he be able to
distinguish virtuous from non-virtuous actions in the first place? Aristotle seems to have a
point that it must be very difficult from someone in these circumstances to come to be virtuous
(though, of course, this doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s impossible). <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Since Aristotle thinks that to
be happy is to live a life of virtuous actions, he must think that this person can&#8217;t be happy.
Do you agree with this judgment, or do you think that this shows a flaw in Aristotle&#8217;s view?

Why?
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Aristotle also thinks that it&#8217;s not enough to act virtuously once or twice. Happiness is not instantaneous
(i.e. it doesn&#8217;t last just for a little bit). For him, it only really makes sense to ask whether you had a happy
life:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >      [T]he happy person has the [stability] we are looking for and keeps the character he
     has throughout his life. For always, or more than anything else, he will do and study the
     actions in accord with virtue, and will bear fortunes most finely, in every way and in all
     conditions appropriately, since he is truly &#8216;good, foursquare, and blameless&#8217;. (1100b18)
     <!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >      And since it is activities that control like, as we said, no blessed [i.e. happy] person
     could ever become miserable, since he will never do hateful or base actions. For a truly
     good and prudent person, we suppose, will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from
     his resources at any time will do the finest actions, just as a good general will make the
     best use of his forces in war, and a good shoemaker will make the finest shoe from the
     hides given to him, and similarly for all other craftsmen. (1101a34)</div>

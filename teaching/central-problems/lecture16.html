<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Saul Kripke is yet another top logician of his time. He is widely credited with the discovery of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">possible</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">world semantics </span>for modal logic, a feat he accomplished at a young age. The series of lectures published as
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Naming and Necessity </span>have been very influential in the philosophy of language, metaphysics, and perhaps
the philosophy of mind.
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   Thought there is much to be said about these series of lectures, we&#8217;ll focus on some aspects of his
discussion of Russell&#8217;s and Frege&#8217;s theory of names. By the time Kripke gave these lectures, Russell&#8217;s
theory was taken as orthodoxy, with philosophers disagreeing only about the details. Kripke&#8217;s objections
represent a serious challenge to the theory, and together with Hilary Putnam&#8217;s influential work, gave rise to
a philosophical doctrine called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">externalism</span>.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Kripke&#8217;s reconstruction of the Frege/Russell theory of names</h1>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >We have discussed the theories of names by Frege and Russell. Though Russell thought of his theory as a
competitor to Frege&#8217;s, many people thought that it was instead a natural development of the
former, which improved it in some important ways. We won&#8217;t examine these exegetical issues
here.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   For our purposes, it will suffice to say that there is a certain interpretation of Frege&#8217;s theory on
which Russell&#8217;s theory can be seen as its development. On this interpretation, a name&#8217;s sense is
something like a definite description. Definite descriptions are treated according to Russell&#8217;s
analysis.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   In his second lecture, Kripke explicitly states the theory he wants to attack as a conjunction of six
theses and one independent constraint:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">To  every  name  or  designating  expression  &#8216;X&#8217;,  there  corresponds  a  cluster  of  properties,
     namely the family of those properties <span

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03D5;X</span>&#8217;.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">One of those properties, or some conjointly, are believed by A to pick out some individual
     uniquely.

class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y </span>is the
     referent of &#8216;X&#8217;.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">

class="enumerate-enumitem">The statement, &#8216;If X exists, then X has most of the <span

     idiolect of the speaker).</dd></dl>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (C) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">For any successful theory, the account must not be circular. The properties which are used in
     the vote must not themselves involve the notion of reference in such a way that it is ultimately
     impossible to eliminate.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Kripke thinks that (1)-(6) pretty much summarize Russell&#8217;s theory, if not in letter, certainly in spirit.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Recall that according to Russell, ordinary names are usually just definite descriptions in disguise. So,
for instance, the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; is just an abbreviation for &#8216;the most famous teacher of Alexander the
Great&#8217;. John Searle, another philosopher, pointed out that this couldn&#8217;t be right. If &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; is just an
abbreviation for the description &#8216;the most famous teacher of Alexander the Great&#8217;, then the sentence
&#8216;Aristotle was the most famous teacher of Alexander the Great&#8217; would express a tautology, and as such, it
would express a necessary truth.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   But that sentence doesn&#8217;t express a necessary truth: Aristotle could have failed to be the most famous
teacher of Alexander the Great. He could have hit his head early on and died at a young age, or the rock
could have caused him some sort of cognitive impairment, ultimately preventing him from being a
teacher of Alexander the Great. You see where this is going. Moreover, as Frege himself noted,
different people could associate different descriptions (or modes of presentation) with the same
name.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   Because of these problems, Searle and others thought that Russell&#8217;s theory had to be reformulated. On
the reformulation of the theory, names are not abbreviations of definite descriptions, but clusters of
such descriptions. So perhaps &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; would be something like the cluster of descriptions
&#8216;the most famous teacher of Alexander the Great, or the center of the Nicomachean Ethics, or
the most prominent disciple of Plato, ...&#8217; The view that Kripke considers is this reformulated
view.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   However, even this reformulated view has several problems. These notes present Kripke&#8217;s arguments
against the reformulated descriptivist view.
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Against (6)</h1>
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >Call <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">&#x0393; </span>the cluster of properties that are associated with the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217;. Thesis (6) states that &#8216;if X
exists, then X has most of the <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03D5;</span>s&#8217; expresses a necessary truth (in the idiolect of the speaker). For instance,
that &#8216;If Aristotle exists, then Aristotle has most of the properties in <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">&#x0393;</span>&#8217; expresses a necessary
truth.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   But this is not so: that Aristotle did all the things that he in fact did is merely a contingent matter. For
instance, Aristotle could have died early on in his life, in which case he would not have been able to do any
of the great deeds that we now attribute to him. Even if we somehow introduced the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; by
using the properties in <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">&#x0393;</span>, it would still not have been necessary that Aristotle had had those
properties.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   For instance, suppose that someone introduces the name Aristotle in the following way: &#8216;I will use
the name &#8220;Aristotle&#8221; to denote the person who wrote the Nicomachean Ethics, was the most
famous teacher of Alexander the Great, invented syllogistic logic, etc.&#8217; In that case, would
thesis (6) hold of the thing that is in fact denoted by the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217;? Kripke doesn&#8217;t think
so.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   According to Kripke, proper names in ordinary language are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">rigid designators</span>: they name the same
thing in all possible worlds. So that if <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in fact </span>the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; names Aristotle, then it would name
Aristotle regardless of how his life was or of the things he did. Of course, if I introduce the name
&#8216;Aristotle&#8217; by means of the description above, it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">could have turned out </span>that the name &#8216;Aristotle&#8217; had
named something else. But given the actual referent of the name&#8212;given how we in fact use the
name, if you wish&#8212;it names Aristotle in all possible worlds. Here is a clarificatory note by
Kripke:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >When  I  say  that  a  designator  is  rigid,  and  designates  the  same  thing  in  all  possible
     worlds, I mean that, as used in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">our </span>language, it stands for that thing, when <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">we </span>talk about
     counterfactual situations. I don&#8217;t mean, of course, that there mightn&#8217;t be counterfactual
     situations  in  which  in  the  other  possible  worlds  people  actually  spoke  a  different
     language. One doesn&#8217;t say that &#8216;two plus two equals four&#8217; is contingent because people
     might have spoken a language in which &#8216;two plus two equals four&#8217; meant that seven is
     even. Similarly, when we speak of a counterfactual situation, we speak of it in English,
     eve  if  it  is  part  of  the  description  of  that  counterfactual  situation  that  we  were  all
     speaking German in that counterfactual situation. (p. 77)</div>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >We won&#8217;t discuss at length his arguments for this claim. If you are interested in those arguments, you should
read the first lecture in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Naming and Necessity</span>. We shall continue to focus on the objections to the
descriptivist theory.
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Against (2)</h1>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >(2) says that a person who uses a name and associates certain property or properties in <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">&#x0393; </span>with that name
believes that some or all of those properties pick out an individual <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">uniquely</span>. That Russell endorsed
something like this thesis should be clear from his analysis of definite descriptions. On that
analysis, a sentence like &#8216;the door is open&#8217; says that there is exactly one door (i.e. a unique
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
thing that is a door) and that thing is open. The thesis seems to have some plausibility insofar
as we usually think that, when we use a name, there is a unique thing that we want to talk
about.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   However, Kripke points out that, even if people normally associate certain properties with a name,
those properties rarely pick out a unique thing. Should we think that every person in the street associates
some uniquely instantiated description with the name &#8216;Cicero&#8217;? Presumably not. If anything, most of us
will associate with the name something like the description &#8216;a roman orator&#8217;, which doesn&#8217;t pick out an
object uniquely, since there were many roman orators.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Here is another example. Suppose I tell you that Feynman is one of my intellectual heroes. When you
ask me: who is Feynman? It may suffice that I answer &#8216;a famous physicist&#8217;. But again, there are many
famous physicists, so it doesn&#8217;t seem that my answer would be adequate if the descriptivist theory was
correct. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Kripke further elaborates his argument using the non-circularity condition (C); what
kind of response is he trying to counter?
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40004"></a>Against (3)</h1>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >According to (3), &#8220;if most of the <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">&#x03D5;</span>s, suitably weighted, are satisfied by a unique object <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y</span>, then <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y </span>is the
referent of the name for the speaker.&#8221; (p. 83). Against this thesis, Kripke uses a compelling example.
Perhaps you don&#8217;t know this, but Kurt Gödel proved the incompleteness of arithmetic&#8212;the first
incompleteness theorem states that any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary
arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete; in particular, for any consistent, effectively generated
formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but
not provable in the theory.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s suppose that you don&#8217;t know much more about Gödel than this. According to (3), then whoever
turns out to have proved the first incompleteness theorem will be the referent of the name &#8216;Gödel&#8217;. But
suppose (contrary to fact) that Gödel did not prove the incompleteness of arithmetic. Instead, some other
man called &#8216;Schmidt&#8217; did. Gödel just stole his proof or something like that and then made sure that Schmidt
disappeared under mysterious circumstances.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   If (3) is true, then when you use the name &#8216;Gödel&#8217; you are really referring to Schmidt, because he is the
person who satisfies the description you associate with the name. So whenever you use the name &#8216;Gödel&#8217;,
you really are talking about Schmidt. But, Kripke points out, that simply isn&#8217;t true. If you were to utter
something like &#8216;Gödel seems to be a smart guy&#8217;, you will be saying something about Gödel, not about
Schmidt.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   The argument doesn&#8217;t merely rely on intuition. As Kripke points out, we often use names on the basis
of incorrect beliefs. If (3) were true, instead of having false beliefs about certain people that we want to talk
about, we would instead have true beliefs about people that we have never met; moreover, those beliefs
would be tautological (see objection to (6) above).

<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >According to (5), it is known a priori by someone who uses the name &#8216;X&#8217; that if X exists, then X has most
of the properties in <span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">&#x0393;</span>. Of course, there can be counterexamples of the style Kripke has already presented.
Yet he is more interested in showing that some more sophisticated ways of fixing the theory won&#8217;t
succeed.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   Suppose, for instance, that the property that Gödel is supposedly known to have a priori (if it exists) is
not that of having proved the incompleteness of arithmetic, but rather, the property of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being thought </span>to
have proved the incompleteness of arithmetic by most people. Kripke points out that, besides
the possibility of counterexamples, this requirement potentially violates the non-circularity
requirement. In order for us to know a priori that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">if G</span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">ödel exists, then he is thought to have</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">proved the incompleteness theory</span>, we first need to be able to think about Gödel. But how will
our reference to Gödel be guaranteed? If reference were only guaranteed by the use of the
description &#8216;the man who is thought to have proved the incompleteness of arithmetic&#8217;, this
would violate the circularity condition, and similarly for any other putatively reference-fixing
description.
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   So how, then does the reference itself get started? At this point, and after having examined the
descriptivist theory, Kripke proposes a new theory, or rather, a new picture of how reference
works.
<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   Here is his new picture, in his own words:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Someone, let&#8217;s say, a baby, is born; his parents call him by a certain name. They talk
     about him to their friends. Other people meet him. Through various sorts of talk the

     of  this  chain,  who  has  heard  about,  say  Richard  Feynman,  in  the  market  place  or
     elsewhere, may be referring to Richard Feynman even though he can&#8217;t remember from
     whom he first heard of Feynman or from whom he ever heard of Feynman. He knows
     that  Feynman  is  a  famous  physicist.  A  certain  passage  of  communication  reaching

     even though he can&#8217;t identify him uniquely. He doesn&#8217;t know what a Feynman diagram
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     is, he doesn&#8217;t know what the Feynman theory of pair production and annihilation is. Not
     only that: he&#8217;d have trouble distinguishing between Gell-Mann and Feynman. So he
     doesn&#8217;t have to know these things, but, instead, a chain of communication going back
     to Feynman himself has been established, by virtue of his membership in a community
     which passed the name on from link to link, not by a ceremony that he makes in private
     in his study: &#8216;By &#8220;Feynman&#8221; I shall mean the man who did such and such and such and
     such&#8217;. (pp. 91-2)</div>

class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Is this new picture compatible with Frege&#8217;s original solution to the puzzles about identity?
why or why not? if not, how can we solve the puzzle if Kripke&#8217;s objection are correct?
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   Kripke ends this lecture by arguing that identity statements involving names are necessarily true, but
known a posteriori. He summarizes his argument as follows:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >We use &#8216;Hesperus&#8217; as the name of a certain body and &#8216;Phosphorus&#8217; as the name of a
     certain body. We use them as names of those bodies in all possible worlds. If, in fact,
     they are the same body, then in any other possible world we have to use them as the
     name of that object. And so in any other possible world it will be true that Hesperus is
     Phosphorus. So two things are true: first, that we do not know a priori that Hesperus is
     Phosphorus, and are in no position to find out the answer except empirically. Second,
     this  is  so  because  we  could  have  evidence  qualitatively  indistinguishable  from  the
     evidence we have and determine the reference of the two names by the positions of two
     planes in the sky, without the planets being the same. (p. 104)</div>

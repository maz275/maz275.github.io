   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>The argument from overdetermination</h1>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Some people have used this argument against dualism. Let&#8217;s start by introducing a couple of
definitions:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Causal overdetermination:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">An event <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>is causally overdetermined just in case it is caused by at
     least two different events, where each of these events would have sufficed by itself to cause <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x</span>.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >Causal overdetermination is usually illustrated with the case of the firing squad: suppose a firing squad is
instructed to kill a given person, A. The shooters fire in such a way that multiple bullets hit A <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">at the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">same time</span>, each of them reaching a vital spot, the destruction of which would cause immediate
death. Had only one of the bullets reached its target, it would have sufficed to cause A&#8217;s death,
but as it happens, all the bullets reached their target, and so, they all caused A&#8217;s death. In this
case, we say that A&#8217;s death is causally overdetermined. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>can you think of other cases
of causal overdetermination? Should we expect causal overdetermination to be a widespread
phenomenon?
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   Now let&#8217;s introduce the thesis of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causal closure of the physical domain:</span>
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Causal closure:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">If a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physical </span>event has a cause, it has a sufficient <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physical </span>cause.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >According to this claim, if we trace the chains of causes of a physical event, at every step in the chain, we will
find a physical event. For instance, suppose that we are playing pool, and I put ball 8 in one of the corner
pockets. We may ask: what caused ball 8 to go into that pocket? In this case, let&#8217;s suppose, what
caused that event was the event of the cue ball hitting it in such and such way. What caused
that event was my hitting the cue ball with the cue, and what caused this was the movement
of my arms in such and such ways while holding the cue. We could trace the event of ball
8 going into the pocket up to the big bang! What matters is that all the events in this chain
had <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physical causes</span>, if they had a cause at all. Part of the reason to accept this claim is that
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
we don&#8217;t really have any reason to posit any non-physical causes in order to explain physical
events.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Now we are in a position to state the argument. We can start with the premise that some mental events
cause physical events. So far, we are not making any assumptions whether physicalism or dualism is
correct, we are just stating the intuitively compelling claim that things like our beliefs, desires and
sensations cause some physical events: if I feel like my hand is burning, I will remove it from the fire; if I
believe that there is chocolate in the cupboard and I want chocolate, I will take a look at the cupboard,
etc.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   By <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causal closure</span>, all those physical events&#8212;my removing my hand from the fire, or my moving
towards the cupboard&#8212;have physical causes. This is where the argument gets interesting. Now we have
two options, either:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (i) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The beliefs, desires and sensations that caused the events in question are themselves physical
     in nature, or
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (ii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The  beliefs,  desires  and  sensations  that  caused  the  events  in  question  are  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">not  physical  </span>in
     nature.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >If the first is true, then we have already accepted physicalism, and our work is done. We can make sense of the
fact that our believes, desires and sensations cause our movements and so on, because those believes,
desires and sensations are themselves physical.
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   Now let&#8217;s take a look at the second claim. If (ii) was the case, then every physical event which is
allegedly caused by a mental event (our having a belief, desire, sensation, etc.) would be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causally</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">overdetermined</span>. The reason is that every such physical event <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">e </span>would have a physical cause&#8212;by the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causal</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">closure of the physical domain</span>&#8212;but if our beliefs, desires and sensations also cause <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">e</span>, and are not
themselves physical, this means that all such events <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">e </span>have two different causes: one mental and one
physical.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Now, there seems to be no problem with some event or other being causally overdetermined, but by the
argument above, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">interactionist dualism </span>is committed to the claim that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">every physical event that has a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">mental cause is causally overdetermined. </span>This seems hard to believe: if interactionist dualism is correct,
then there would be widespread and systematic overdetermination of a lot of physical events. Why should
we think that such overdetermination obtains? And what if the mental and the physical events go out of
sync? A simpler theory is just the theory that no such overdetermination occurs, and (i) is true, but that is
physicalism.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Notice that the argument from overdetermination doesn&#8217;t attempt against all kinds of dualism. In
particular, the following version of dualism can avoid the objection from causal overdetermination:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Epiphenomenalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Mental events are not the same as physical events, and mental events <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">do not</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">cause </span>physical events.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Since epihphenomenalism claims that mental events don&#8217;t cause physical events, it is not committed to the
widespread overdetermination of certain kinds of physical events. However, it avoids the objection at great
cost: it&#8217;s hard to believe that our mental states have absolutely no influence on the physical
world.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   So far we have examined very general views about the nature of the mind, but there are also more
detailed views. We&#8217;ll start considering some of them, but first it will be useful to take a look at a test offered
by Alan Turing.
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Turing&#8217;s test</h1>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >We have been talking a lot about mentality, mental states, and whether mental things are physical or not.
However, we haven&#8217;t yet wondered how we can find out whether something has mentality or not; that is,
whether something has mental states, or is intelligent, or something like that.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   In his paper &#8220;Computer Machinery and Intelligence", Alan Turing offers a test that, according to him,
will allow us to determine whether a computer is genuinely capable of thinking and genuinely intelligent.
The test works like this:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >We have two rooms. In one, there is a human, the interrogator. In the other room, there
     is another human and a computer. The computer and the other person are only known
     as X and Y to the interrogator, and she is not allowed to see them. The interrogator&#8217;s
     objective  is  to  find  out  which  of  the  two  is  the  human  and  which  is  the  computer.
     In order to do this, she may ask any question she wants to the other participants by
     means of a keyboard, and see their answers by means of a screen. The objective of the
     computer is to trick the interrogator into thinking that it is the human, whereas the other
     person&#8217;s job is to help the interrogator.</div>
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >If the computer wins the game often enough, then it passes the test, and so it is genuinely capable of thinking
and genuinely intelligent. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>What do you think about this test? If a computer passes this test, what
would that entail?
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Turing examines various objections to his test, of which we&#8217;ll examine two.
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Machines don&#8217;t make mistakes</h4>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Turing states the objection as follows:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >It is claimed that the interrogator could distinguish the machine from the man simply
     by setting them a number of problems in arithmetic. The machine would be unmasked
     because of its deadly accuracy.</div>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >In order to see the import of the objection, it is important to distinguish between two kinds of mistakes, what
Turing calls <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">errors of functioning </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">errors of conclusion</span>:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >Errors of functioning are due to some mechanical or electrical fault which causes the
     machine to behave otherwise than it was designed to do. In philosophical discussions
     oe likes to ignore the possibility of such errors [...] Errors of conclusion can only arise
     when some meaning is attached to the output signals from the machine. The machine
     might, for instance, type out mathematical equations, or sentences in English. When a
     false proposition is typed we say that the machine has committed an error of conclusion.</div>
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Turing points out that there is no reason to believe that the machine won&#8217;t make the second kind of mistake,
and errors of the first kind are irrelevant. It may be, for instance, that the machine knowingly types a false
claim in response to one of the questions of the interrogator, but it may also be that it makes a mistake in a
more natural sense.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   It all depends on how the machine is programmed. If the machine is programmed in the way in which a
calculator is, then it probably won&#8217;t make mistakes. But if, on the other hand, it is programmed to follow
the kind of reasonings that we use when we perform arithmetic operations, then it could be as prone to error
as we are.<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>What other things are there that you think machines can&#8217;t do, even in
principle?
<!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40002"></a>Lady Lovelace&#8217;s objection</h4>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Lady Lovelace offered our most detailed information of Babage&#8217;s analytical engine, one of the first
computers. She writes:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >The Analytical Engine has no pretensions to originate anything. It can do <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">whatever we</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">know how to order it to perform</span></div>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >The objection is that a machine can&#8217;t really do anything new, and can only have a fixed pattern of
behavior.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   Is this true? In a way, it is true that a machine can only do what its program tells it to do. However, this
doesn&#8217;t mean that the computer will always do the same things, nor does it mean that anyone who
knows how it is programmed will thereby know what the machine will do next, at any given
time.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   For instance, we can program machines that &#8220;learn&#8221;. Jim Pryor offers the following example:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Computers can also be programmed to revise their own programs, to "learn from their
     mistakes." For instance, a chess-playing computer can be programmed to thoroughly
     analyze its opponents&#8217; strategy whenever it loses a game, and incorporate those winning
     strategies into its own database. In this way, it can learn how to use those strategies
     in  its  own  games,  and  learn  how  to  look  out  for  them  in  its  opponents&#8217;  games.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     This  kind  of  computer  would  get  better  and  better  every  time  it  played  chess.  It
     would  quickly  become  able  to  do  things  its  programmers  never  anticipated  (though
     of  course  they&#8217;re  the  ones  who  programmed  it  to  learn  from  its  mistakes  in  this
     way).(http://goo.gl/ZMjqZm)</div>

   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-50002"></a>Attitudes towards the Turing test</h4>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >There are at least three attitudes that we can take towards Turing&#8217;s claims that passing the test is sufficient
for being intelligent or having thoughts:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd

     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">genuinely </span>having thoughts and intelligence.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd

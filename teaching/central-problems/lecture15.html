<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Russell was another top logician and philosopher of his time. Like Frege, Russell got interested in
denotational expressions as a result of his work in logic. He recognized the force of Frege&#8217;s puzzle about
cognitive significance and attitude ascriptions, but thought that Frege&#8217;s view wasn&#8217;t exactly right. In
his paper &#8216;On denoting&#8217; he offers his own view of a certain class of denotational expressions,
namely, definite descriptions. We&#8217;ll assume that, for Russell, proper names are just definite
descriptions in disguise, so that his analysis of the former is the same of his analysis of the
latter.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Preliminaries</h1>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Russell had a special view about propositions, different from Frege&#8217;s view. According to Russell,
propositions are a kind of structured abstract entity. For Russell, it makes sense to say that some object or
property is part of a proposition, and to ask what each element of a sentence contributes to the proposition
that the sentence expresses. Russell thinks that we can only grasp propositions all of whose elements we are
acquainted with.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   This is where the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description comes
in. The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description is concerned with
our knowledge of objects. For Russell, acquaintance is a sort of relation that one has to an object when one
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">immediately </span>knows the object.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Russell&#8217;s preferred example of something that we can know by acquaintance is what he calls a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">sense</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">datum</span>. Sense data are something like raw experiences, if you like. For instance, when you see a red
carpet, you know the color red by acquaintance. There is no need for any mediation between you
and the color red in order for you to know that color. As such, knowledge by acquaintance is
not based on any knowledge of truths or facts, though it often entails the knowledge of some
truth.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Knowledge by description, on the other hand, is indirect. Here is an example by Russell:
     <div class="quote">
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >My knowledge of the table as a physical object, on the contrary, is not direct knowledge.
     Such as it is, it is obtained through acquaintance with the sense-data that make up the
     appearance of the table. We have seen that it is possible, without absurdity, to doubt
     whether there is a table at all, whereas it is not possible to doubt the sense-data. My
     knowledge of the table is of this kind which we shall call &#8220;knowledge by description&#8221;.
     (p. 74)</div>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >According to Russell, we are not directly acquainted with the table. Instead, we know the table by
means of something like the description &#8220;the object that causes in me such and such sense
data&#8221;.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   Russell thought that there were very few things that we could know by description: sense data,
universals (e.g. properties) and the self are among the few things that we can know by acquaintance.
Everything else we must know by description. So, for instance, we only know other minds or other people
by description, and not by acquaintance.
<!--l. 40--><p class="indent" >   Ultimately, Russell thought, all of our knowledge must rest on knowledge by acquaintance. In fact,
even the propositions that we grasp must be based on some sort of knowledge by acquaintance. Recall that
Russell thought that propositions were structured kinds of entities, so that it made sense to talk about the
constituents of a proposition.
<!--l. 42--><p class="indent" >   According to Russell, in order for us to grasp a proposition, we must be acquainted with all of its
components. For this reason, he doesn&#8217;t think that the contribution that a name makes to a sentence in
which it occurs can be its referent or denotation. Instead, it must be some sort of description ultimately
composed of elements with which we are acquainted.
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   For instance, if the sentence &#8216;Venus is pretty&#8217; is to express a proposition that we can grasp, it can&#8217;t
express a proposition that has the planet Venus as a constituent. For in order for us to grasp such
proposition, we would need to know the planet Venus by acquaintance, which we don&#8217;t. This is why he
thinks that in &#8216;Venus is pretty&#8217; the name &#8216;Venus&#8217; must contribute something like a description. For instance,
the proposition expressed by this sentence may be something like: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the object that produces the sensation as</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of shining in the evening is pretty</span>.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   In other words, the contribution that a proper name makes to a sentence must be something like a
definite description: a description that starts with the definite article &#8216;the&#8217; and requires the uniqueness of the
thing that satisfies it. We&#8217;ll see Russell&#8217;s theory of definite descriptions more thoroughly in what
follows.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Russell&#8217;s view of definite descriptions</h1>
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >Unlike Frege, Russell thought that definite descriptions didn&#8217;t have a meaning by themselves. However,
every grammatically correct sentence in which a definite description occurs is meaningful. In
particular, Russell thought that a sentence like &#8216;The morning star is pretty&#8217; really meant: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">there</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is one and only one thing that is the morning star, and that thing is pretty</span>. The details are a
bit more complicated than that, and will be easier to explain after introducing some logical
terminology.
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Aside: Quantifiers</h4>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Sentences can have expressions like &#8216;every&#8217;, &#8216;some&#8217;, &#8216;none&#8217; and the like. These expressions are called
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">quantifiers</span>. In classical logic (the logic developed by Frege), there are two quantifiers that people care
about for the most part: the logical analogs of &#8216;everything&#8217; and &#8216;something&#8217;.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   The symbol &#8216;<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2200;</span>&#8217; is called the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">universal quantifier</span>. The symbol &#8216;<span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2203;</span>&#8217; is called the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">existential</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">quantifier</span>. If you have taken an introductory logic class, you probably know these two symbols by
now.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   As a first approximation, one could say that the universal quantifier is the logical analog of the
English word &#8216;everything&#8217; and the existential quantifier is the logical analog of the English
word &#8216;something&#8217;. However, this is a bit misleading. These two expressions by themselves are
usually not taken to have meanings, or at least not in the sense in which a word like &#8216;cat&#8217; has a
meaning. However, it makes sense to talk about the meaning of the sentences in which they
occur.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   When a quantifier occurs in a logical formula, it is followed by a variable. The most common variables
are <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x,y,z</span>. Immediately after that first variable, we have some further formula in which the variable that
was right after the quantifier may or may not occur. Since this is not a logic class, we&#8217;ll be a bit sloppy
when it comes to the logical notation, and we&#8217;ll use a combination of a standard logical language that
includes quantifiers together with some terms of English.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   For instance, we will translate the sentence &#8216;Every cat is on the mat&#8217; into our new quasi-formal
language as: <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2200;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>(if <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is a cat, then <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is on the mat). Notice that our translation has a conditional form: this
is because we want to restrict our claim that <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is on the mat to the objects <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>that satisfy the condition of
being cats. You should also notice the parentheses. The parentheses are used to indicate that
every occurrence of <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>inside them is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">bound </span>by the quantifier that precedes the parentheses.
The parentheses are something like a device to keep track of the objects that we are talking
about. We will translate the sentence &#8216;Some cat is on the mat&#8217; as <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2203;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>(<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is a cat and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is on the
mat).
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Exercise: </span>Translate the following sentences into our new quasi-formal language:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">

<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >We said that, according to Russell, a sentence like &#8216;the evening star is pretty&#8217; meant something like
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">there is one and only one evening star, and that thing is pretty</span>. Using our new quasi-formal
language, this becomes: <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2203;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>(x is an evening star and <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x </span>is pretty and <span 
class="cmsy-10x-x-109">&#x2200;</span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y </span>(if <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y </span>is an evening star, then
<span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">y </span><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">= </span><span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">x</span>)).
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   With his new theory of definite descriptions in place, Russell is ready to face three puzzles. He thinks
that any good theory of denotational phrases must solve these puzzles. As an important reminder, recall that
Russell thought we could only grasp propositions all of whose components we are acquainted with. So he
thought that proper names were to be analyzed as definite descriptions, and so, even a sentence like &#8216;Venus
is pretty&#8217; will have a form similar to that of &#8216;the evening star is pretty&#8217;&#8212;though perhaps the descriptive
content will be different.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Before presenting his puzzles, Russell discusses at some length two competing theories:
Meinong&#8217;s and Frege&#8217;s. We won&#8217;t examine his criticisms, but you should still read them very
carefully. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Can you make sense of the objection to Frege&#8217;s view involving Grey&#8217;s

     discussed this puzzle at length, so I won&#8217;t present it here again.

class="cmr-10x-x-109">)</span>, where <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">p </span>is a
     variable ranging over propositions, is true. However, there seem to be some problems for the
     law of excluded middle once we consider denotational phrases that don&#8217;t have a referent. For
     instance, consider the sentence &#8216;The present king of France is bald&#8217;. By the law of excluded
     middle,  it  would  seem  that  either  the  present  king  of  France  is  bald  or  the  present  king
     of  France  is  not  bald.  But  there  is  no  present  king  of  France!  In  Russell&#8217;s  words:  &#8220;if  we
     enumerated the things that are bald, and the the things that are not bald, we should not find the
     present king of France in either list&#8221; (p. 485). The puzzle is to explain how the law of excluded
     middle can still hold in the presence of denotational phrases that in fact lack a referent.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (iii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Denotational phrases without a referent cause another problem. We may call it the problem of
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">negative existentials</span>. Consider the sentence &#8216;the man who did all the heroic deeds described
     in the Odyssey doesn&#8217;t exist&#8217;. Because no one did such heroic deeds, the description &#8216;the man
     who did all the heroic deeds described in the Odyssey&#8217; doesn&#8217;t denote anything. But then, how
     can the sentence saying that such a person doesn&#8217;t exist be true? Frege thought that in order
     for the sentence to be true, the description must have a referent. But given that the sentence is
     true, such referent must be a non-existent entity. How can there be an entity that doesn&#8217;t exist?
     This just sounds like a contradiction. In Russell&#8217;s words &#8220;it must always be self-contradictory
     to deny the being of anything&#8221; (p. 485)</dd></dl>

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Russell&#8217;s solution to the puzzles involves an important distinction. One of the reasons we introduced a
special notation for the quantifiers is that Russell&#8217;s distinction can only be precisely formulated using that
notation.

puzzles.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s start with Frege&#8217;s puzzle about attitude ascriptions. The problem was that in some cases we could
substitute one denotational expression for another of the same referent, but this modified the truth value of
the sentence. Russell thinks that, in a way, the puzzle relies on a misunderstanding. He has
been very explicit that denotational phrases don&#8217;t by themselves have a meaning; in particular,
they don&#8217;t <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contribute </span>their denotation to the proposition expressed by a sentence in which they
occur.
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   In that sense, the puzzle arises from a sort of confusion: we can&#8217;t replace a definite description with
another description that contributes the same denotation (i.e. the same object) because definite
descriptions don&#8217;t contribute objects in the first place. So there is no failure of compositionally
here. On the other hand, his view can still account for the difference between &#8220;George wants to
know whether Scott is the center of Waverley&#8221; and &#8220;George wants to know whether Scott is
Scott&#8221;.
<!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >   If &#8216;Scott&#8217; contributed its denotation to a proposition in which it occurs, the second sentence would
express the proposition: George wants to know whether Scott=Scott. But recall that Russell thinks we can
only grasp propositions all of whose constituents we are acquainted with. So &#8216;Scott&#8217; must really be a
definite description in disguise. For the sake of simplicity, let&#8217;s assume that the name &#8216;Scott&#8217; is the
description &#8216;the man named Scott&#8217; in disguise. Then the two sentences in question mean the following,
respectively:

<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, there are certain cases in which we think we can substitute a definite description for
another with the same denotation. As Russell points out, we can still get those cases right, but in those

<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Consider &#8216;the present king of France is bald&#8217;. Russell thinks that the law of excluded middle entails that that sentence should

Since not all definite descriptions have denotations (&#8216;the present king of France&#8217; is an example of this),
Russell&#8217;s conclusion would be difficult to adopt if a definite description contributed its denotation to
sentences in which it occurs.
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   However, Russell delivers his preferred result easily. The solution has to do with the distinction
between de dicto and de re occurrences of a description. Consider the following two ways of negating the
sentence &#8216;the present king of France is not bald&#8217;:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (n1) </dt><dd

<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" >On Russell&#8217;s analysis, these two sentences correspond to:

     king of France, then y=x))

there is no present King of France&#8212;i.e. it&#8217;s not the case that there is one and only one present
king of France and that person is bald, because there is no present king of France. In (n2<sup><span

on the other hand, the description occurs de dicto, and the sentence is false because it claims
that there is one present king of France and that person is bald, yet there is no present king of
France.

doesn&#8217;t exist&#8217;. But on Russell&#8217;s analysis, the latter is equivalent to simply saying: &#8216;there is nothing that has

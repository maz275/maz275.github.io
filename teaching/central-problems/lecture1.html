 id="x1-10001"></a>What is Philosophy?</h1>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Before addressing some philosophical questions, it may be natural to wonder what philosophy is. As with
any other enterprise, it seems reasonable to want to know something about Philosophy before spending our
time and resources in its pursuit. As it turns out, it is very difficult to tell what Philosophy is, but let&#8217;s give it
a try anyway.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   One way in which we could define Philosophy is by its methods: if it turned out that there are certain
methods that are only used when we do philosophy and which are all used in philosophy, then any
discipline that used those methods would be a philosophical discipline. Yet it&#8217;s not clear that there is a
unique methodology that unifies Philosophy: some philosophers try to analyze our concepts as we use
them; others make formal models of certain phenomena and explore their formal properties, hoping this
will help them understand the phenomena they are interested in; other philosophers examine empirical
evidence and try to offer some conceptual clarification in the places where scientists need it. As you may
imagine, this is not an exhaustive list.
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   Should we expect one of these approaches to be the one true method of philosophy? If so, which one
and why? What&#8217;s so special about that method that makes it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">more philosophical </span>than the others, or that
makes the others less philosophical than that special one? What is it for one method to be more
philosophical than the others in the first place?
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps we should approach the matter in a different way. Maybe philosophy is defined
not by its methods, but by its questions. Perhaps there is a special set of questions that are
addressed by philosophy, and which only philosophy can address. Yet many interesting scientific
questions have started as philosophical questions, and only thanks to certain advances
(sometimes technological, sometimes philosophical!) have we been able to tackle them
scientifically.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>
Moreover, many philosophers these days are helping answer questions that would otherwise seem to be in the domain
of the sciences.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1002f2"></a>
On a different side of the spectrum, philosophers are also concerned with questions about what we ought to
do, how to live our lives, and so on, but not all philosophers concern themselves with these questions either.

We&#8217;ve gotten into another blind alley.
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   Luckily, we don&#8217;t need to know all the details of what philosophy is in order to start philosophizing&#8212;just
like we don&#8217;t need to know all the details about fishing in order to learn how to fish, or all the details about
cooking in order to learn how to cook. What we do need are certain examples of good philosophy.
Throughout the course we will examine many such examples from many acclaimed philosophers. The
readings we will discuss have either been very influential or are paradigmatic of what many of us these
days consider interesting or good (sometimes only one of them, sometimes both) philosophical
work.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Some of the questions we&#8217;ll be examining have probably occurred to you before: how should we
live our lives? What makes a person? What&#8217;s in a mind? Other questions you probably hadn&#8217;t
considered before, but once you are presented with them it&#8217;s easy to see how pressing they
are.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   By the end of the course, once you have familiarized yourself with some of its questions, you will be in
a position to form a more sophisticated opinion about what Philosophy is. For now, we can learn an
important lesson from our failed attempt to define it. The lesson is that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">we don&#8217;t always need to start with a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">definition of the subject matter of our enquiry</span>. Rather, we should expect that a good definition should be, if
anything, the result of our research.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   The first body of questions that we will examine in this course concern value and what constitutes a
good life. As a warm up, let&#8217;s consider some remarks by Robert Nozick on what we value and what
constitutes a good life.
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Nozick&#8217;s experience machine</h1>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >Nozick presents us with the following thought experiment:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >Suppose there were an experience machine that would give you any experience you
     desired. Superduper neuropsychologists could stimulate your brain so that you would
     think  and  feel  you  were  writing  a  great  novel,  or  making  a  friend,  or  reading  an
     interesting book. All the time you would be floating in a tank, with electrodes attached
     to your brain. (<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Anarchy, State, and Utopia</span>, p. 42)</div>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Nozick spends some time discussing the logistic complications of the machine, but let&#8217;s suppose no such
complications arise. Once you enter the machine, you only have desirable experiences, and all your desires
for more experiences are satisfied.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">From the inside</span>, the experiences fed to your brain by the machine are indistinguishable from whatever
you would experience if you were <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">really </span>doing the things that in the real world would produce
your experiences. Someone in the machine wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell that all her experiences are
machine-made. After presenting the case, Nozick poses some interesting questions: should we plug
into this machine for life? what else could matter to us besides how our lives feel from the
inside?
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Nozick thinks that the machine is a good thought experiment that can help us decide what matters to
us. Because he thinks that very few of us would plug into the machine, he thinks that what

matters to us must be something over and above our experiences, or how we live our lives from
the inside. This is not the end of Nozick&#8217;s point. To some extent, he also wants to offer some
arguments in support of the view that the story about what matters to us doesn&#8217;t end in our
experiences.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   For instance, we often care about doing something or other: saving the people you love from pain or
death, securing resources for future generations, etc. Once you enter the experience machine, you
could do none of those things. You could, of course, program the machine so that you have the
experiences you would have had if you had in fact done those things, but you can&#8217;t do the things
themselves.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Nozick seems to have a strong case that we care about more than just our experiences. It is enough to
notice that we care about the results of our actions, and the experience machine by itself impedes us from
performing any actions, or from our desires and thoughts having any result in the actual world. But that&#8217;s
not where his discussion ends.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   We also care about who we are, and Nozick makes some interesting remarks on this matter. He claims
that after some time of having entered the machine, there is no way a person is:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Someone floating in a tank is an indeterminate blob. There is no answer to the question
     of  what  a  person  is  like  who  has  long  been  in  the  tank.  Is  he  courageous,  kind,
     intelligent, witty, loving? It&#8217;s not merely that it&#8217;s difficult to tell; there&#8217;s no way he is.
     Plugging into the machine is a kind of suicide.</div>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>Why does Nozick think this? Is he right?
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   In principle, we wouldn&#8217;t seem to have much reason to believe him. Why would the mere fact that you
are not interacting with the world make it so that there is no way a person in the machine is? After all, the
people plugged into the machine would still have mental states (e.g. the experiences themselves), together
with states very much like our ordinary beliefs and desires. So why is Nozick so adamant that plugging into
the machine is a kind of suicide?
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps this point is related to his third claim about what we care about. He claims that we care about being in contact
with some deeper reality.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn3x0" id="fn3x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f3"></a>
Is this true? Imagine that we all live in a computer simulation so perfect that it&#8217;s impossible to know from
the inside that we live in a simulation. In fact, if all of a sudden someone took us out of the simulation and
into the real world, we wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell either.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   Scenarios like this have been considered by many philosophers and artists. Thus, Descartes in his
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Meditations on First Philosophy </span>considers the possibility that he is tricked by an evil demon, but really
everything he has ever experienced is an illusion. The famous Spanish poet and writer Pedro
Calder?n de la Barca briefly considers the matter in the voice of Segismund, in the play <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Life is a</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">dream</span>.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn4x0" id="fn4x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2002f4"></a>
More recently, the Wachowski siblings consider the scenario in the movie <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">The Matrix</span>, and the
philosopher Nick Bostrom has considered the thought that we are in fact living in a computer
simulation.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn5x0" id="fn5x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2003f5"></a>
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   We won&#8217;t settle the question whether we live in a simulation or how we could know either way. But it&#8217;s
important to ask whether it really matters to us not to live in a simulation. How bad would it be that none
we are not &#8220;in contact with any deeper reality&#8221;, as Nozick would put it? Should we think that our lives are
any less valuable for that reason, or would we think that being in contact with some deeper reality wasn&#8217;t as

important as we originally thought?

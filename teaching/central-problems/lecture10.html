<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Locke is concerned with determining the conditions under which something persists through time. For
the time being, we will understand this as the question under which conditions a given object at some point
in time is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">identical </span>to a given object at some future point. When Locke talks about the principle of
individuation, he is talking about such conditions.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>Preliminaries</h1>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Before considering the identity of persons, Locke considers the identity of other things: what he calls
substances, plants, animals, and artifacts. He thinks that what makes an substances persist through time is
being composed of the same matter. Things are a bit more complicated when it comes to the identity of
plants and animals.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   According to Locke, a plant persists through time just in case it retains the functional organization of its
components, even if it is not composed of exactly the same matter. He thinks the same is true of animals an
some artifacts: &#8220;For Example, what is a Watch? &#8217;Tis plain &#8217;tis nothing but a fir Organization, or
Construction of Parts, to a certain end, which, when a sufficient force is added to it, it is capable to attain.&#8221;
(?5)
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   When it comes to a person, his whole discussion relies on distinguishing between levels of description.
We may ask about the identity conditions for a person seen as a mere <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">substance</span>, whether it is the body or
some thinking substance (what Locke would call a soul). At a higher level, we may ask for the identity
conditions of a person, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">seen as an animal</span>; this is what Locke calls &#8216;a man&#8217;. Finally, we may ask
for the identity conditions of a person proper, with which Locke is mostly concerned in this
chapter.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Before presenting Locke&#8217;s view, it will be useful to have some criteria for assessing it. We may call one
such criterion <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">purely formal</span>. Locke has promised us a theory of what it makes a person at a given
time identical to a person at some future time. He takes this task to be the one of offering a
principle of individuation for people. If his theory succeeds, we should expect that his principle
of individuation accounts for some formal properties of identity: reflexivity, symmetry, and
transitivity.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   A relation is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">reflexive </span>just in case everything in its domain stands in the relation to itself. Identity is

transitive because everything is identical to itself, but the relation of being someone&#8217;s parent is not, because
no one is her own parent. A relation is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">symmetric </span>just in case: if object X stands in the relation to object Y,
then object Y stands in the relation to X. Identity is symmetric because if X=Y, then Y=X. The relation of
being someone&#8217;s parent is not symmetric because if A is a parent of B, that doesn&#8217;t entail that B is also a
parent of A. Finally, a relation is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">transitive </span>just in case, if X stands in the relation to Y, and Y stands in the
relation to Z, then X stands in the relation to Z. Identity is transitive, but the relation of being someone&#8217;s
parent is not.
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   In principle, any good theory of personal identity should deliver the result that the relation <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">same person as </span>should be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, if we are to take it seriously as an identity
relation.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   In addition to this formal criterion, we have a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">substantive criterion</span>. This criterion demands that a theory
of personal identity deliver the right predictions or judgments on whether two given people at different
times are one and the same person. We may understand the substantive criterion as the requirement that the
theory of personal identity under consideration is (a) not subject to counterexamples, and (b)
comprehensive enough to cover all the cases in which two people at different times are one and the
same.
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Locke&#8217;s views on personal identity</h1>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Here is a passage from Locke&#8217;s book:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >[S]ince  consciousness  always  accompanies  thinking,  and  &#8217;tis  that,  that  makes  every
     one to be, what he calls <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">self </span>; and thereby distinguishes himself from all other thinking
     things, in this alone consists <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">personal identity</span>, i.e. the sameness of rational Being: And
     as far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past Action or Thought,
     so far reaches the Identity of that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Person</span>; it is the same <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">self  </span>now it was then; and &#8217;tis
     by the same self with this present one that now reflects on it, that that Action was done.
     (?9)</div>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >What Locke says is that a person later in time will be the same as some person earlier in time just in case the
latter remembers everything that happened to the person earlier in time. Let&#8217;s make this more precise by
saying that, according to Locke, a person A at time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> is the same as person B at time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0+</span><span 
class="cmmi-8">n</span></sub> just in case, at
time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0+</span><span 
class="cmmi-8">n</span></sub>, person B remembers all the experiences and thoughts that A went through at <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> Locke&#8217;s
criterion of identity is sometimes called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the psychological criterion of identity </span>for obvious
reasons.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   For the rest of the chapter, Locke is concerned with making some precisions and presenting some of the
consequences of his view. We&#8217;ll see if this consequences are acceptable from the point of view of the
substantive and formal criteria, respectively:
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   As Locke is quick to admit, his view on personal identity entails that someone who is asleep and is
not dreaming is not the same person as the one who went to bed that night, or the one that
will wake up in the morning. The person who goes to bed and the person who wake up might
well be one and the same, but the person who is asleep is different. Moreover, Locke seems

to say that, strictly speaking, there is no person who is asleep, since to be a person is to be
conscious and having thoughts, perceptions, and the like. On the assumption that dreamless sleep is
devoid of thoughts, perceptions, and the like, there is no consciousness present when a body
sleeps.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Ordinarily, we wouldn&#8217;t think that someone ceases to exist merely because she went to sleep. In fact,
we often speak as if the person who is asleep is one and the same with the one who went to bed and the one
that will wake up in the morning. We say things like &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear the phone because I was
asleep&#8221;. If Locke is right, those things are, strictly speaking false, since a person is not present
during sleep. As far as the substantive criterion goes, Locke&#8217;s view doesn&#8217;t seem to be doing
well.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Locke is also very clear that, on his view, it is possible for a single person to inhabit two different
bodies at two different times. This would happen if somehow we managed to transfer all the
memories from one body to another, without leaving any trace in the original body. Similarly, if
immaterial souls, rather than bodies, are the places where we store our memories and that have our
sensations, if we managed to transfer someone&#8217;s memories from one soul to another, Locke
thinks that the same person would have inhabited one soul originally, but another after the
transfer.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps it is because Locke&#8217;s ideas have laid roots into our culture, but it&#8217;s difficult to resist
this sort of conclusion. Sometimes with comical intentions, some fictional works present us
with a situation in which two people swap bodies. In those kind of situations, the person with
one body remembers many of the events that happened to the other body from a first-person
perspective, and have the inclinations and character that the other body used to have, etc. So insofar
as our intuitions concerning personal identity go, this consequence of Locke&#8217;s view seems
unproblematic.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Forgetfulness and amnesia seem to present more pressing challenges. Locke&#8217;s criterion of identity
requires a person to have the same memories as another one. However, I may easily forget certain details of
what happened yesterday, or even what I had for breakfast this morning. If we adopt Locke&#8217;s demanding
criterion of identity, we will be forced to conclude that I am not the same person as the one that had
breakfast this morning or that was teaching class yesterday. But again, this seems contrary to some very
natural intuitions.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   A more radical case is one in which someone has amnesia. If Locke is right, if I have an accident and as
a result I get amnesia, I won&#8217;t be the same person as the one that had the accident. This is not
merely a metaphorical way of speaking: Locke quite literally says that I wouldn&#8217;t be the same
person. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>What would happen if all of a sudden I recovered my memory? Who would I
be?
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Whatever one thinks of the amnesia case, surely I won&#8217;t be a new person just because I forgot what I
had for breakfast, so perhaps we should amend Locke&#8217;s criterion. Perhaps we shouldn&#8217;t demand that a
person remembers <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">everything </span>that happened to her past self, but only that she remembers <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">enough </span>of the
things that happened to her past self.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately, this still seems to be too restricting. In a single day, I have many different experiences of
which I can only remember very few, so even this new criterion won&#8217;t deliver the right results. One way of
amending this criterion is to say that identity between people at different times merely requires
remembering some important events, or some set of events suitably defined. As long as we have some
independently motivated way of determining those important events, it seems we can save the spirit of
Locke&#8217;s view from counterexamples.

<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Later in the class we&#8217;ll see some more sophisticated counterexamples to Locke&#8217;s thesis, but for now
let&#8217;s see if it can satisfy the formal requirements, starting with reflexivity. Because identity is reflexive,
everyone is identical to herself. Is it true that, at any given time, a person has exactly the same memories
as herself at that same time? Surely it is, so Locke&#8217;s view at least respects the reflexivity of
identity.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Things are not so easy with symmetry. Consider John at time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> and John at time <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></sub>, and suppose that
John at <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">10</span></sub> remembers everything that happened to John at <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub>. Unfortunately for Locke, this doesn&#8217;t entail
that John at <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">0</span></sub> remembers everything that happened to John at <span 
class="cmmi-10x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="cmr-8">1</span></sub><span 
class="cmr-10x-x-109">0</span>, since those things hadn&#8217;t happened yet!
So the relation of remembering everything that happened to someone is not symmetric.<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>How do
you think that Locke could solve this problem?
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   Locke&#8217;s theory doesn&#8217;t have a better Locke with transitivity. The british philosopher named Thomas
Reid noticed this and wrote about it in one of his <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Essays on the intellectual powers of men</span>. He presents us
with the following case:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >      Suppose a brave officer to have been flogged when a boy at school, for robbing an
     orchard, to have taken a standard from the enemy in his first campaign, and to have
     been made a general in advanced life: Suppose also, which must be admitted to be
     possible, that when he took the standard, he was conscious of his having been flogged
     at school, and that when made a general he was conscious of his taking the standard,
     but had absolutely lost the consciousness of his flogging.
     <!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >      These things being supposed, it follows, from Mr LOCKE&#8217;s doctrine, that he who
     was flogged at school is the same person who took the standard, and that he who took
     the standard is the same person who was made a general. When it follows, if there
     be any truth in logic, that the general is the same person with him who was flogged
     at school. But the general&#8217;s consciousness does not reach so far back as his flogging,
     therefore, according to Mr LOCKE&#8217;s doctrine, he is not the person who was flogged.
     Therefore the general is, and at the same time is not the same person as him who was
     flogged at school (Essays, 276).</div>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Reid argues against Locke by <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">reductio ad absurdum</span>: he shows that from Locke&#8217;s theory together with some
plausible premises&#8212;in particular, the transitivity of identity&#8212;we can derive a contradiction. Since there are
no true contradictions, we must reject one of the premises. We can&#8217;t reject the transitivity of identity, so
instead we must reject Locke&#8217;s theory.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   What Reid&#8217;s example illustrates is simply that the relation of remembering everything that happened to
someone is not transitive. In this case, the general remembers what happened to the official, and the official
remembers what happened to the boy, but the general doesn&#8217;t remember what happened to the boy. Because
the relation of remembering what happened to someone else is not transitive, Locke&#8217;s view also fails in this
respect.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   There are ways out of these objections. What we need is to find a relation that is close enough in spirit
to the relation Locke offers, but that unlike that relation, is both transitive and relation. Let&#8217;s start with
transitivity: traditionally, philosophers observed that even though the relation of remembering what
happened to someone is not transitive, there is another relation in the vicinity that is transitive: let&#8217;s call that
relation <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">psychological continuity</span>, even though other people may not use the expression that
way.

<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   In Reid&#8217;s case, the general remembers what happened to the official and the official remembers what
happened to the boy. So the general stands in the following relation to the boy: the relation of
remembering what happened to someone who remembers what happened to him (the boy). If this is
the relation that defines personal identity, we don&#8217;t need to worry about Reid&#8217;s case anymore.
Unfortunately, our new relation can only be a provisional solution: if we have a long enough series of
people that is relevantly like the series presented by Reid, that will be enough to raise a new
objection.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Luckily, we can generalize this newly introduced relation to avoid those problems. Say that A is
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">psychologically connected </span>to B just in case A remembers everything that happened to B&#8212;we could
relax the relation and just ask that A remembers most of what happened to B, or the important
things that happened to B, etc. This is basically our old, non-transitive relation, but we can
use it to define a new, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">transitive </span>relation. Say that A is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">psychologically continuous </span>with B just
in case they belong to a series of people each of which is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">psychologically connected </span>to her
predecessor. This new relation solves problems like Reid&#8217;s, but as we&#8217;ll see later it has some other
problems.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Notice that our newly minted relation also solves the problem with symmetry. For if A belongs to the
same series of psychologically connected people as B, then B belongs to the same series of psychologically
connected people as A. So perhaps Locke&#8217;s theory was wrong in the letter, but at least so far
we have managed to deflect some of the objections against its spirit coming from the formal
requirements.
<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Further objections</h1>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps the criteria above have been successfully met, but that doesn&#8217;t mean there are no more
objections. One famous objection is known as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the circularity objection</span>. This new objection is not
concerned with the truth of Locke&#8217;s theory. Instead, it is concerned with whether it is explanatory or
informative.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   By the beginning of the course, we saw some cases of definitions that were not explanatory. For
instance, it&#8217;s not explanatory or informative to define chairs as the kinds of things that fulfill the function of
chairs. The circularity objection is of this kind. It points out that the relation of remembering something
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">presupposes </span>identity: you simply can&#8217;t remember what happened to other people. You can remember seeing
what happened to other people, of course, but that&#8217;s not the point. You can&#8217;t remember the experiences of
other people, or doing things that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">you </span>didn&#8217;t do. This is usually taken to be a fact about what it is to
remember something.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   But if this is true, then Locke&#8217;s account is not explanatory. If it succeeds, it only succeeds because it
uses a relation that itself presupposes identity, in which case Locke hasn&#8217;t really explained what grounds
that identity itself.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Some people have tried to amend Locke&#8217;s view by changing the kinds of mental states that are required
for psychological continuity. Derek Parfit is among the people who discuss this new view. The new view
requires the introduction of a new word, &#8216;quasi-memory&#8217;. A person <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">quasi-remembers </span>something just in case
she has something that is qualitatively indistinguishable from a memory, but that doesn&#8217;t presuppose
identity. For instance, I could quasi-remember everything that happened to you if someone
makes some sort of copy of your brain and then puts that information into my brain. Parfit then

defines psychological continuity in terms of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">quasi-memories </span>rather than in terms of genuine
memories.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   This new theory apparently can solve this version of the circularity objection, but it seems to have
deeper problems. For surely being psychologically continuous in this new sense is not sufficient for
identity. If someone leaves my memories intact and just inputs some quasi-memories of yours into my
brain, that doesn&#8217;t mean that I&#8217;m identical to you. I may, for instance, be perfectly aware that these are not
genuine memories, or be perfectly aware that I never did the things that the quasi-memories represent their
holder as doing, yet still have those quasi-memories. We&#8217;ll continue to discuss some interesting issues
concerning personal identity in future sessions.

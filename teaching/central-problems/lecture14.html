<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   Ordinarily, there are only certain expressions that we would call proper names. Examples of proper
names are &#8216;Carla&#8217;, &#8216;Anna&#8217;, &#8216;John&#8217;, etc. However, Frege insists that his theory should apply to anything that
denotes a single object. In ordinary speech, expressions using the definite article &#8216;the&#8217; or certain
descriptions could be taken to fall in that class. When Frege talks about proper names, he intends to talk
about all the expressions that refer to a single object. Thus, the proper names will include, besides things
like &#8216;Anna&#8217; and &#8216;Maria&#8217;, things like &#8216;the morning star&#8217; or &#8216;the evening star&#8217;. We&#8217;ll continue to discuss
Frege&#8217;s theory of sense and reference.
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-10001"></a>More on modes of presentation</h1>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >We saw that Frege postulates the distinction between sense and reference to solve a particular puzzle about
identity. His solution was to say that &#8216;Carla is Maria&#8217; and &#8216;Carla is Carla&#8217; express relations between objects
(Carla and herself) but at the same time they convey more information because the names &#8216;Carla&#8217; and
&#8216;Maria&#8217; have different modes of presentation.
<!--l. 28--><p class="indent" >   Perhaps &#8216;Carla&#8217; presents Carla as my friend who used to live in New Jersey, whereas &#8216;Maria&#8217; presents
Carla as my friend who used to work in Arizona and now lives in North Carolina. Just to make
things clear, let me introduce yet another example. Ancient astronomers introduced two names
&#8216;Hesperus&#8217; and &#8216;Phosphorus&#8217; as the names of celestial objects. They introduced &#8216;Hesperus&#8217;
to talk about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the evening star</span>, the first celestial body visible in the evening. They introduced
&#8216;Phosphorus&#8217; to talk about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the morning star</span>, the last celestial body visible in the morning (besides the
sun).
<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   After some astronomical studies, these ancient astronomers came to discover that Hesperus was in fact
the same thing as Phosphorus. When they discovered that Hesperus was Phosphorus, they discovered
something genuinely novel that they didn&#8217;t know before. To any ancient astronomer not in
the know, the sentence &#8216;Hesperus is Phosphorus&#8217; would have been informative, whereas the
sentence &#8216;Hesperus is Hesperus&#8217; wouldn&#8217;t have been informative. Now suppose I tell you that
Hesperus is Venus. Again, you will have learned something that you wouldn&#8217;t have learned if
I had just told you that Hesperus is Hesperus, or that Hesperus is Venus. In this case, Frege
would say that &#8216;Hesperus&#8217; <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">denotes </span>or refers to Venus, and it presents Venus under the guise
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
of the evening star. Phosphorus also denotes Venus, but it presents the latter as the morning
star.
<!--l. 32--><p class="indent" >   Frege thought that senses or modes of presentation were <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">public</span>, and anyone who knew how to use the
name &#8216;Hesperus&#8217; would also know its sense. This is why he is careful to distinguish between the mode of
presentation that comes with a name or is part of the meaning of a name and the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">conceptions a person may</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">associate with a name</span>. An associated conception is something like a mental image. Perhaps when I say the
name &#8216;Carla&#8217; you have in mind a certain picture, or you are filled with memories of your experiences with
her. These pictures and memories are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">not </span>part of the sense of the name &#8216;Carla&#8217;. This is because those
pictures and memories are subjective: they are not available to anyone but yourself. Sense and
reference, on the other hand, must be public; available to anyone who knows how to use the
term.
<!--l. 34--><p class="indent" >   Frege thinks that only a person who has a particular conception can have that particular conception. He
offers a good illustration with his example involving a telescope:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >      Somebody observes the moon through a telescope. I compare the moon itself to the
     referent; it is the object of the observation, mediated by the real image projected by the
     object glass in the interior of the telescope, and by the retinal image of the observer. The
     former I compare to the sense, the latter to the conception or experience. The optical
     image in the telescope is indeed one-sided and dependent upon the standard point of
     observation; but it is still objective, inasmuch as it can be used by several observers. At
     any rate it could be arranged for several observers to use it simultaneously. But each
     one would have his own retinal image. (p. 213)</div>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >According to Frege, every name has a sense, and if a sense determines a referent, it determines a unique
referent. However, any given referent can be associated with multiple names, each with its own sense. Not
every sense has a referent, which we will illustrate when discussing the sense and reference of declarative
sentences.
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >
   <h1 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>The sense and reference of declarative sentences</h1>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Frege has distinguished between two levels of meaning: sense and reference. He also thinks that
declarative sentences express what he calls <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">thoughts</span>. Now the question is whether that thought is the
sense or the reference of a sentence. But first we need to understand what Frege means by a
thought.
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Aside: what are thoughts, according to Frege?</h4>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >Frege devotes a paper of its own to explain what he takes thoughts to be&#8212;unsurprisingly, his paper is called
&#8220;The thought, a logical inquiry&#8221;. We won&#8217;t read the paper in class, but it&#8217;s important to have a clear idea of
what he means. In that paper, he calls thoughts those things for which the question of truth arises (Frege
1956, p. 292).
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   For Frege, thoughts are not a certain kind of mental state, or something that happens inside a person&#8217;s
head. They are more like abstract entities. Declarative sentences express thoughts. Here is a brief passage
from his article clarifying the idea:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >      Without  wishing  to  give  a  definition,  I  call  a  thought  something  for  which  the
     question of truth arises. So I ascribe what is false to a thought just as much as what
     is true. [...] The thought, in itself immaterial, clothes itself in the material garment of
     a sentence and thereby becomes comprehensible to us. We say a sentence expresses a
     thought.
     <!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >      A  thought  is  something  immaterial  and  everything  material  and  perceptible  is
     excluded from this sphere of that for which the question of truth arises. (Frege 1956, p.
     292)</div>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >In order to avoid confusion, it will be useful to use a different word. What Frege calls thoughts, we will call
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">propositions</span>.
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Propositions are rarely defined, and their nature is often the object of contention. However, many
philosophers agree that propositions are:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (i) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The primary bearers of truth values.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (ii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The objects of our beliefs and knowledge.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (iii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The things expressed by declarative sentences.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >In general, it is taken to be a contingent fact whether any given sentence expresses some particular proposition.
For instance, the sentence &#8216;pigs don&#8217;t fly&#8217; expresses the proposition or the thought that pigs don&#8217;t fly.
However, that very same sentence could have expressed a different proposition: if &#8216;pig&#8217; had meant <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">whale</span>
instead of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">pig</span>, the sentence &#8216;pigs don&#8217;t fly&#8217; would have expressed the proposition that whales don&#8217;t
fly.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   We call the conditions on which a proposition is true its <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">truth conditions</span>. Any given proposition has its
truth conditions <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">essentially</span>: that proposition couldn&#8217;t exist without having the truth conditions that it in fact
has. Declarative sentences also have truth conditions, but they are often taken to have truth conditions
merely in virtue of expressing some proposition or other. Because of this, sentences have the truth
conditions that they actually have only <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contingently</span>.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40002"></a>Back to Frege on sense and reference</h4>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Frege thought that sentences expressed what we now call propositions. But this still doesn&#8217;t answer the
question whether propositions are the sense or the referent of a declarative sentence. As it happens, Frege
thought that propositions were the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">senses </span>of sentences, and that the referents of sentences were
truth-values, i.e. truth or falsity.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   His argument in favor of this argument involves an interesting principle that we might call
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">principle of compositionally of reference</span>. Here is Frege&#8217;s statement, which we will clarify in a
moment:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Let us assume for the time being that the sentence has a referent! If we now replace
     one word of the sentence by another having the same referent, but a different sense,
     this can have no influence upon the referent of the sentence. Yet we can see that in such
     a case the thought changes; since, e.g., the thought of the sentence &#8220;The morning star
     is a body illuminated by the sun&#8221; differs from that of the sentence &#8220;The evening star
     is a body illuminated by the sun.&#8221; Anybody who did not know that the evening star is
     the morning star might hold the one thought to be true, the other false. The thought,
     accordingly, cannot be the referent of the sentence, but must be rather considered as the
     sense. (214-5)</div>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >From these observations, Frege concludes that thoughts or propositions can&#8217;t be the referents of sentences, so
they must be their senses.
<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s reconstruct his argument by first stating the principle of compositionally of reference more
precisely:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Compositionality of reference:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The reference of a sentence is wholly determined by the referent
     of its parts together with the way in which they are combined.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >It follows from the principle of compositionally of reference that if we substitute some element
of a sentence by another with the same referent, the referent of the sentence should be the
same.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Here&#8217;s one way of reconstructing the argument:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If sentences <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">referred  </span>to propositions, the substitution of a term in a sentence by one with
     the  same  referent  shouldn&#8217;t  change  the  proposition  that  the  sentence  expresses.  (by  the
     compositionally of reference)
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Sometimes, if we substitute an element of a sentence with another one with the same referent,
     the  proposition  expressed  by  the  sentence  changes  (from  Frege&#8217;s  example  in  the  passage
     above).
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">So sentences don&#8217;t refer to propositions.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >What do sentences refer to, if not propositions? Frege thinks that they refer to truth values, i.e. truth or
falsity.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Frege doesn&#8217;t offer a demonstrative argument for this conclusion. Rather, he presents the
conclusion as a result of an educated conjecture. First, the referent of a sentence should be
something such that if we substitute one element in sentence for another with the same referent,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
the referent of the sentence should remain constant. Second, whenever one of the elements of
a sentence lacks a referent, the question whether the sentence is true or false doesn&#8217;t arise.
But if we took the question of its truth seriously, we would need to assume that every element
of the sentence has a referent. Third, it seems that we are only concerned with the referent
of a name to the extent that we care about the truth value of a sentence in which that name
occurs.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   From these observations, Frege conjectures that the referent of a sentence must be its truth value.
Notice that this seems to respect the principle of compositionally of reference. For instance, if the referent
of a sentence is a truth value, that explains why I can substitute &#8216;Maria&#8217; for &#8216;Carla&#8217; in &#8216;Carla likes apples&#8217;
without changing the truth value of the sentence. Those kinds of substitutions are usually said to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">salva</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">veritate </span>(truth-preserving).

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Frege just claimed that the referent of a sentence is a truth value. Unfortunately, this, in conjunction with
the principle of the compositionally of reference, leads to trouble. Consider the following pairs of

<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >Each of the b-sentences can be obtained by substituting one proper name after &#8216;that&#8217; by another name
with the same denotation. According to the principle of compositionally of reference, such
substitutions should preserve truth value. Unfortunately, those substitutions don&#8217;t preserve truth value
in these cases. In each case, the a-sentence can be true and the b-sentence false in the same
situation. In the case of 4, for instance, that will happen if John doesn&#8217;t know that Hesperus is
Phosphorus.
<!--l. 110--><p class="indent" >   Using the distinction between sense and reference won&#8217;t solve this problem: the problem is not that
Frege can&#8217;t make sense of the difference in cognitive value between the a and b sentences. His view so far
predicts that the sentences in each pair have different senses. The problem is that if the referent of a
sentence is a truth value, we have a failure of compositionality.

this purpose. Here is what he says on the distinction:

     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">customary </span>from its <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">indirect  </span>sense. The indirect referent of a word is accordingly its
     customary sense. (pp. 211-2)</div>
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >This may sound a bit confusing, but it really is not. All we need to keep in mind is that the sense of an
expression, whatever the expression is, determines its referent (if it has one).
<!--l. 120--><p class="indent" >   We know that the referent of a name is the object that it denotes. Its sense, on the other hand, is
something in the vicinity of a description that holds uniquely of the referent. With respect to declarative
sentences, we know that their senses are propositions and their referents are truth values. These
senses and referents are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">customary </span>because they are the ones that names and sentences usually
have.
<!--l. 122--><p class="indent" >   Frege explicitly says that the indirect referent of a linguistic expression is its customary
sense. Thus, the indirect <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">referent </span>of a name is its sense, and the indirect referent of a sentence
is the proposition that it expresses. What about their indirect <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">sense</span>? Well, we know that the
sense of an expression determines its referent. So if in some circumstance the referent of a
name &#8216;n&#8217; is its customary sense, we can speculate that the indirect sense of that expression
will be something like this description: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the ordinary sense of the name &#8216;n&#8217;</span>; similarly, we can
speculate that the indirect sense of a sentence &#8216;s&#8217; will be something like this description: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">proposition expressed by sentence &#8216;s&#8217;</span>. With this in mind, we can tackle the puzzle about attitude
ascriptions.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 124--><p class="indent" >   The problem was that if the referent of a sentence is always its truth value, then there are
counterexamples to the principle of compositionally of reference. But what if, in the problematic cases, the
words in the embedded clause didn&#8217;t have their customary referents, but instead they had their indirect
referents? In that case, the referent of &#8216;Hesperus&#8217; as it occurs in 4a wouldn&#8217;t be Venus, but something like
the description &#8216;the evening star&#8217;. The referent of &#8216;Phosphorus&#8217; as it occurs in 4b wouldn&#8217;t
be Venus either, but something like the description &#8216;the evening star&#8217;. These two senses are
different, so it&#8217;s not surprising that once we substitute one for the other, the referent of the
whole sentence is altered. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Do you think this solves the new puzzle? Why or why
not?
<!--l. 126--><p class="indent" >   For the rest of the paper, Frege shows that this solution to the new puzzle is not <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">ad hoc</span>. He shows this
by offering a systematic analysis of the cases in which an expression doesn&#8217;t have its customary referent,
but only its indirect referent.

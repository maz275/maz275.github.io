 id="x1-10001"></a>What a good theory of propositional attitudes should look like</h2>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Fodor presents a set of requirements on a good theory of propositional attitudes, and offers some defense of
them. These are the requirements:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (I) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Propositional attitudes should be analyzed as relations. Attitude verbs express relations between a
     subject of the attitude and something else. Part of the reason to accept this view comes
     from apparent syntax: Fodor is assuming that a sentence like &#8216;John believes that Mary is
     coming&#8217; has the same syntactic structure as &#8216;Mary ate my lettuce&#8217;, which has a noun
     phrase in its top node, and a predicate formed of a verb and a noun phrase [NP<span 
class="ptmr8t-x-x-80">1</span>[V NP<span 
class="ptmr8t-x-x-80">2</span>]].
     Since these kind of sentences are usually taken to express relations between the two
     noun phrases, Fodor takes this to be good evidence that sentences ascribing propositional
     attitudes should also express relations. He offers some further evidence supporting his
     claim:
          <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       a. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Unlike other superficially relational expressions, it&#8217;s not clear how we could translate
          sentences ascribing propositional attitudes into sentences that are not committed to the
          existence of a denotation for the that-clause.
          </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       b. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">In general, existential generalization applies to the syntactic objects of verbs of propositional
          attitudes. For instance, if it is true that A believes that dogs are filthy, it follows that there
          is something that A believes.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1004f1"></a>
          </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       c. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The relational view of attitude ascriptions is the only game in town. The alternative, as far as
          Fodor knows, is the view that sentences like &#8216;A believes that p&#8217; ought to be syntactically parsed
          as &#8216;A believes-that-p&#8217;, where the predicate here has no further structure. Here are some
          considerations against such a view:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
              <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
            i. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The productivity of belief attributions.
              </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
           ii. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Different propositional attitudes can have the same content. E.g. someone can both
              fear and believe that there&#8217;s a monster in the closet.
              </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
          iii. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There can be logical relations between beliefs.
              </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
           iv. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There  is  a  correlation  between  indicative  sentences  of  English  and  the  things
              that  seem  to  be  embedded  in  that-clauses.  The  fusion  view  doesn&#8217;t  explain  this
              correlation.
              </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
           v. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The relation between the truth of a belief and the truth of the sentences we use to
              characterize that belief.</dd></dl>
          </dd></dl>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (II) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">A theory of propositional attitudes should explain the parallelism between verbs of propositional
     attitudes and verbs of saying. The things that can be said to be believed are the same kinds of things
     that can be said to be said. Fodor states this condition as arising from syntax, but we can make a
     distinction between two different conditions, one linguistic and one corresponding to the content of
     beliefs themselves. The linguistic constraint comes from the observation that the syntactic behavior
     of &#8216;said that&#8217; and &#8216;believes that&#8217; is the same. The observation about content comes from the
     fact that, in some cases, the following sentences are true: &#8216;I believe what she said&#8217;, &#8216;I
     desire the same thing that she fears&#8217;, and the like. That these sentences are true seems to
     imply that the content of sayings is the same kind of thing as the content of propositional
     attitudes.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (III) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">A theory of propositional attitudes should account for their opacity. We can&#8217;t substitute
     expressions with the same referent in belief attributions <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">salva veritate</span>. Again, we can
     distinguish between a linguistic constraint and a constraint related to the content of beliefs: the
     linguistic constraint requires us to figure out a semantics for attitude ascriptions that allows
     for the failures of substitutivity. The constraint on content requires us to explain what
     the content of propositional attitudes is, such that we can describe it by means of those
     sentences.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (IV) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">&#8220;A theory of propositional attitudes should legitimize the ascription of form to objects
     of propositional attitudes. In particular, it should explain why the form of a belief is
     identical to the logical form of the correspondent of a sentence which (opaquely) ascribes
     that belief.&#8221; (p. 546) Fodor notes that the contents of propositional attitudes must be
     non-arbitrarily related to the causal chains that explain our behavior. This is crucial for stating
     folk-psychological laws of the following kind: if x believes that A is an action x can perform,
     and if x believes that the performance of A is sufficient to bring it about that Q, and if
     x wants it to be the case that Q, then x acts in a fashion intended to be a performance
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     of A. According to Fodor, these generalizations are specified by reference to the form
     of the content of a propositional attitude. So, if propositional attitudes are to play any
     role in the explanation of our behavior, they better have the same form as the kind of
     statements that we use to state such laws. He adds two further reasons to accept this
     condition:
          <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       a. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">We may want to compare beliefs with respect to their form: A&#8217;s belief that p and q is the
          conjunction of B&#8217;s belief that p and C&#8217;s belief that q.
          </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       b. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">We may wish to speak of the logical consequences of a belief, even though we admit
          that the consequences of a belief may not be themselves the objects of a belief.</dd></dl>
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (V) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">A theory of propositional attitudes should mesh with empirical accounts of mental processes.</dd></dl>

   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Carnap&#8217;s theory</h2>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >Fodor observes that Carnap&#8217;s theory does surprisingly well in satisfying the criteria offered above. Let&#8217;s
start by stating Carnap&#8217;s theory:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Carnap&#8217;s theory:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">propositional attitudes are relations between people and the sentences they are
     disposed to utter, e.g. between people and sentences of English. In particular, to believe that
     P is to be disposed to utter tokens of the sentence &#8216;P&#8217;.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s go one by one:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   I. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">It&#8217;s  easy  to  see  that,  on  Carnap&#8217;s  view,  propositional  attitudes  are  analyzed  as  relations
     between the subject of the attitude and something else: sentences. It&#8217;s also easy to see how
     if a belief is true, then so is the sentence embedded under the that-clause, since the sentence
     embedded is what is believed.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  II. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">On this account, saying that P and believing that P are relations to tokens of the same sentence,
     so there is no mystery as to how these two kinds of sentences are syntactically similar.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  III. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">On  this  account,  attitudes  are  relationships  to  sentences  syntactically  individuated,  not  to
     propositions or the like. So it&#8217;s not surprising that we can&#8217;t substitute one sentence for other
     with the same truth value while preserving truth: someone may bear the required relation to
     one sentence, but not to the other.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  IV. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">On  Carnap&#8217;s  account,  the  logical  form  of  the  object  of  a  propositional  attitude  is  just  the
     logical form of the sentence that we embed in the belief report.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  V. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">An  example  of  the  kind  of  empirical  explanations  that  Carnap&#8217;s  view  can  explain  is  the
     following. We can start with the observation that some beliefs are more complex than others,
     and that the complexity of a belief seems to be correlated with the complexity of the sentences
     we use to describe it. We would have an explanation of this fact if our account of the content
     of  propositional  attitudes  allowed  us  to  predict  the  complexity  of  a  mental  state  from  the
     complexity of whatever the theory assigns as the object of the attitude. Carnap&#8217;s theory can
     easily explain this fact, since it can claim that the complexity of a mental state depends on
     the complexity of the sentence that constitutes the object of the belief relation. This in turn is
     related to the complexity of the sentences we use to describe propositional attitudes.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Thus, Carnap&#8217;s theory is pretty good at satisfying the requirements, but it&#8217;s not perfect. Fodor points out the
following problems:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (i) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Carnap&#8217;s view is behavioristic. But there are plenty of reasons to reject behavioristic accounts
     of  propositional  attitudes.  Notice  that  this  only  affects  Carnap&#8217;s  account  of  the  relation
     between subjects and sentences, but it doesn&#8217;t require modifying the view about the objects of
     the relation. For instance, Carnap could reformulate the view along functionalist lines while
     keeping the claim that the objects of the relation are token sentences of English.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (ii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Carnap&#8217;s view is too fine-grained. Plausibly, &#8216;Sarah believes that Suárez bit Chiellini&#8217; and
     &#8216;Sarah believes that Chiellini was bitten by Suárez&#8217; ascribe the same belief. However, the
     sentences embedded under the that clauses of these two ascriptions are different, so Carnap&#8217;s
     view predicts that the beliefs they ascribed are different too.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (iii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Someone can believe that it&#8217;s raining even though she doesn&#8217;t speak English.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (iv) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Someone can believe that it&#8217;s raining even if she doesn&#8217;t speak any language at all.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (v) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Some beliefs may be inexpressible. Carnap&#8217;s view can&#8217;t make room for this. What could such
     a belief be? Suppose that space is Newtonian (there is an infinite amount of space and there
     is no privileged point in it). Then, there is a sense in which you don&#8217;t know where you are
     in all that space. But, as it happens, this kind of ignorance can&#8217;t be expressed (see Dasgupta
     2014) by any sentence in English (or at least it&#8217;s not clear how one would express it). Carnap
     is committed to thinking that it&#8217;s not true that one doesn&#8217;t know his position in Newtonian
     space. Needless to say, this should not be considered a devastating argument.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (vi) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If token sentences are the objects of propositional attitudes, how are first languages learned?
     Presumably,  the  process  of  learning  a  language  involves  generalizations  on  the  data,
     formulation of hypotheses, etc. All of these must involve beliefs, expectation, and the like.
     So, on pain of circularity, there must be some propositional attitudes which are not relations
     to sentences of English.</dd></dl>

   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>The Language of Thought to the rescue</h2>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Most of the problems with Carnap&#8217;s view come from its use of sentences of natural language. Fodor
proposes to correct the theory by taking the objects of propositional attitudes to be sentences (formulas) of
a non-natural language, or an Internal Representational System (a language of thought). He then argues that
this sort of view can satisfy the conditions he has offered so far.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Condition I is satisfied merely by the fact that propositional attitudes are analyzed as relations.
Condition III is satisfied in pretty much the same way as Carnap&#8217;s view satisfied it, with the sole difference
that the sentences in question now are sentences in a language of thought.
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   Conditions II and IV can be seen as imposing the requirement that the sentences in the language of
thought that we ascribe relations to have the same truth conditions as the sentences in natural language that
we use to attribute those relations. The that-clause in the attitude ascription connects the ascription to
a formula in the internal language of the believer, but it also connects that internal formula
with a sentence in natural language: the sentence embedded in the ascription by means of the
that-clause.
<!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >   The idea is that the conventions of natural language establish pairings of natural language sentences
with sentences in a language of thought. This is compatible with the individuation of a given formula in the
language of thought by means of the functional role that it has in the production of utterances of the
sentence it is related to.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   Fodor claims that this view escapes the objections presented against Carnap&#8217;s view on the following
assumption:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >letÂ&#x0165;s assume that the internal language is innate, that its formulae correspond one-one
     with  the  contents  of  propositional  attitudes,  and  that  it  is  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">as  </span>universal  as  human
     psychology; viz. that to the extent that an organism shares our mental processes, it also
     shares our system of internal representations. (p. 551)</div>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >On this assumption, the objections above don&#8217;t apply to the language of thought hypothesis. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question:</span>
Why?
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Still, some people may think that this hypothesis is just implausible. In its defense, Fodor claims that
our best psychological theories are committed to the truth of the hypothesis anyway. He illustrates as
follows. Consider the ambiguous sentence &#8216;they are flying planes&#8217;. The ambiguity of this sentence is
usually understood to be derived from the fact that there are two ways of understanding the syntactic
structure of the sentence. This in turn is usually understood as there being a function from strings of
symbols to syntactic structures. But what, asks Fodor, determines that some such function is the correct
one? It&#8217;s not very explanatory just to say that it is given by the grammar of English. For there may be
competing grammars of English, and nothing we&#8217;ve said so far seems to determine that one rather than the
other is the correct one. He thinks there is only one way in which the question can be answered:
the right function is the one that speakers of English use to represent the sentences of their
language. This of course commits us to the existence of something like an internal system of
representation.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40003"></a>Objection 1</h4>
<!--l. 101--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Why not take the objects of propositional attitudes to be propositions? </span>Fodor thinks that, insofar as the
internal representation system is a language, it should be possible in principle to offer a syntax and a
semantics for it, and the hypothesis is in principle compatible with the claim that formulas in the language
of thought express propositions or are related to propositions in pretty much the same sense in which
sentences of natural language are related to propositions. In this sense, he is quite happy to say that
propositional attitudes are mediated relations to propositions. However, his main worry is that, if
propositions are understood as abstract entities, it&#8217;s not clear how an organism can stand in a relation to a
proposition except by standing in a causal or functional relation to some token formula which expresses the
proposition.
<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">It is conceivable that propositional attitudes are not relations to internal representations. </span>Fodor thinks that
this is true, but it&#8217;s not damaging. He&#8217;s offering an empirical account of the phenomenon, not an analysis.
Contrast this with some physical theory: it is metaphysically possible that there is a world in
which our best physical theory is false, but this doesn&#8217;t mean that such theory is false in the
actual world. To the more interesting question regarding the possibility of beings with different
systems of representation, Fodor hopes that there will be translations between the systems of
internal representation, so that expressions in formally different systems can express the same
proposition.

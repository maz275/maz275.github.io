<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Smart wants to focus on a certain kind of mental states, namely, what we may now call <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">conscious </span>states.
Examples of these kinds of mental states are all sorts of sensations, like <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">pain</span>, or Smart&#8217;s &#8220;roundish,
blurry-edged after-image which is yellowish towards its edge and orange towards its centre." (Smart, p. 60)
<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   His main theses about these sorts of mental states is a version of what some people later called
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Identity Theory</span>. The basic tenet of the view is that mental states <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">are just </span>certain kinds of physical
states. Strictly speaking, the view can be stated in more general ways&#8212;for instance, that all
mental properties are just physical properties&#8212;but let&#8217;s focus on the view that Smart has in
mind.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Smart thinks that mental states&#8212;he only talks about sensations, but he must think that his claim
can be generalized to all sorts of mental states&#8212;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">are just </span>brain processes of a certain kind. He
says:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >      Let  me  first  try  to  state  more  accurately  the  thesis  that  sensations  are  brain
     processes. It is not the thesis that, for example, &#8220;after-image&#8221; or &#8220;ache&#8221; means the same
     as &#8220;brain process of sort X&#8221;. It is that, in so far as &#8220;after-image&#8221; or &#8220;ache&#8221; is a report of
     a process, it is a report of a process that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">happens to be </span>a brain process. It follows that the
     thesis does not claim that sensation statements can be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">translated </span>into statements about
     brain processes [...] All it claims is that in so far as a sensation statement is a report of
     something, that something is in fact a brain process. (p. 62)<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >      When  I  say  that  a  sensation  is  a  brain  process  or  that  lightning  is  an  electric
     discharge, I am using &#8220;is&#8221; in the sense of strict identity. When I say that a sensation
     is a brain process or that lightning is an electric discharge I do not mean just that the
     sensation is somehow spatially or temporally continuous with the brain process or that
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     the lightning is just spatially or temporally continuous with the discharge. (p. 62)</div>
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Smart considers some objections to these view. Here we will consider the most interesting
ones.
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20001"></a>An objection from a priori knowledge</h4>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Argument: </span>We can make claims about our sensations without having any knowledge of our brain processes.
But if sensations were just brain processes, we would know that they are. Thus, the things we talk about
when we describe our sensations are not brain processes.
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   One way to reconstruct the argument is this:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If A and B are the same, then this must be known a priori.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">For  any  brain  process  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>and  sensation  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">y</span>,  we  don&#8217;t  know  a  priori  that  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>is  the  same  as  <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">y</span>;
     therefore,
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">For any brain process <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>and sensation <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">y</span>, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">y </span>are not the same thing.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>What do you think about this argument? Is it a good reconstruction of the intuitive
characterization? Do you think it&#8217;s related to Descartes&#8217; argument that he is not his body in the second
meditation? Why?
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   For our purposes, it will be worth examining this argument more closely. By now you should
understand the notions of necessity and possibility, and in particular the notion of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysical necessity</span>.
You may have also noticed that the argument above requires the notion of something being known <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">a priori</span>.
What is this? The answer is still controversial, but you can take the following as our working
definition:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">A priori:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Something is knowable a priori (for a subject S) just in case it can be known (by S)
     without the aid of empirical information.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >We should be careful on how to understand empirical information here. For instance, we may think that coming
to understand a language requires empirical information, but linguistic knowledge is not the kind of thing
that friends of the a priori want to talk about. What they want to rule out are things that you come to know
through your senses, like the fact that the grass is green, or that your hair is of a certain color, or even that
you look the way you do.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   In the past (when Smart wrote his paper), people used to confuse <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">aprioricity </span>with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysical</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">necessity</span>. Though Smart himself seems to make this mistake, he also offers an interesting consideration in
response to the argument:
     <div class="quote">
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Consider lightning. Modern Physical science tells us that lightning is a certain kind
     of electrical discharge due to ionization of clouds of water-vapor in the atmosphere.
     This, it is now believed, is what the true nature of lightning is. Note that there are not
     two things: a flash of lightning and an electrical discharge. There is one thing, a flash
     of  lightning,  which  is  described  scientifically  as  an  electrical  discharge  to  the  earth
     from a cloud of ionized water-molecules. The case is not at all like that of explaining
     a footprint by reference to a burglar. We say that what lightning really is, what its true
     nature as revealed by science is, is an electric discharge. (p. 63)</div>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30001"></a>Phenomenal properties</h4>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Smart attributes the following argument to Max Black: even if the objection above doesn&#8217;t show that
sensations are not brain processes, it shows that
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >the qualities of sensations are something over and above brain processes. That is, it may
     be possible to get out of asserting the existence of irreducibly psychic processes, but not
     out of asserting the existence of irreducibly psychic <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">properties</span>. For suppose we identify
     the Morning Star with the Evening Star. Then there must be some properties which
     logically imply that of being the Morning Star, and quite distinct properties which entail
     that of being the Evening Star. Again, there must be some properties (for example, that
     of being a yellow flash) which are logically distinct from those in the physicalist story.</div>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Think about the planet that was known long ago as the evening star and the morning star. Even though the
actual evening star and the actual morning star are in fact the same thing, there is a sense in which
the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">property </span>of being the morning star is not the same as the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">propoerty </span>of being the morning
star.
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   The first is the property of being the last celestial body visible in the morning. The second
is the property of being the first celestial body visible in the morning. These two are clearly
different properties, but as it happens, they are actually instantiated by the same celestial body
(Venus).
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Black&#8217;s point is somewhat similar: we may accept that sensations <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">are just </span>brain processes. That is,
whenever we experience pain, say, it&#8217;s not the case that there are two different things, one of which is a
sensation, and another which is a brain process. Black&#8217;s point is that even if we accept this, we can insist
that there are two different kinds of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">properties</span>, one which is purely mental, and some others which are
completely physical.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   In particular, even though our sensation might be a brain process, it has a property that is not physical,
to wit, there is something the sensation feels like. For instance, when we experience a pain, our
sensation has the property of feeling a certain way. This property, Black claims, is not a physical
property.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   The view that Smart attributes to Black is usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">property dualism</span>. It claims that there may be
only one kind of substance, but there are at least two kinds of properties. For some reason, Smart claims
that Black&#8217;s view is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">epiphenomenalism</span>, which we will discuss later.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-40002"></a>Separating meanings</h2>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Some people, especially by the time Smart, Feigl and others introduced the identity theory, conflated not
only metaphysical necessity with aprioricity, but they also conflated these two with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">analyticity</span>. What is
this? The answer is also a matter of controversy, but roughly, philosophers agree that a sentence is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">analytic</span>
if it is true in virtue of its meaning. Today, some people deny that any sentence is analytic, but a standard
definition of analyticity is this, due to Paul Boghossian:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Analyticity:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">A sentence <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">s </span>is analytic just in case knowledge that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">s </span>is true is required by competence
     in its use.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >The notion of analyticity has been recently attacked, but we need not worry about this for now.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   With the notion in place, we can see what the first argument was trying to get at: some people in the
past thought that, since identities were necessary, any true identity statement had to be analytic. Since the
statement of identity between sensations and brain processes is not analytic, this must mean that it is not
true, or so these people thought.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   This is why Smart and Feigl make an extra effort to distinguish their view from the view that
sensation-words and brain-process-words mean the same. Indeed, it is part of their view that the identity
statements in question are known only with the aid of experience, and so, they are neither a priori nor
analytic:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >The  &#8220;mental&#8221;  states  or  events  (in  the  sense  of  raw  feels)  are  the  referents  (dentate)
     of both the phenomenal terms of the language of introspection, as well as of certain
     terms of the neurophysiological language [...] The identification, I have emphasized, is
     to be empirically justified, and hence there can be no logical equivalence between the
     concepts (or statements) in the two languages.</div>
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Feigl goes on as to how we may discover that these identities hold:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 100--><p class="noindent" >The empirical character of the identification rests upon the extensional equivalencies,
     or extensional implications, which hold between statements about the behavioral and
     the neurophysiological evidence. In our example this means that all persons to whom
     we ascribe an after-image, as evidenced by certain stimulus and response conditions,
     also have cerebral processes of a certain kind, and vice versa. (Feigl, pp. 69-70)</div>
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003"></a>Arguments for Identity Theory</h2>
<!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >Smart offered one of the first arguments in favor of the identity theory (or, if you want, against
dualism). It is an argument from the simplicity of the identity theory and the complexity of
dualism:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >Dualism involves a large number of irreducible psychophysical laws of a queer sort,
     that just have to be taken on trust, and are just as difficult to swallow as the irreducible
     facts about the paleontology of the earth with which we are faced on Philip Gosse&#8217;s
     theory. (Smart, p. 67)</div>
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >The main intuition behind the argument is pretty simple, and we may even trace it to Princess Elisabeth. You
may recall that at some point in her correspondence with Descartes, Elisabeth said that she would find more
plausible to identify the mental with the physical than to understand the kind of links that would allow the
mental to cause physical events, and vice versa.
<!--l. 111--><p class="indent" >   Smart is saying something similar: interactionist dualism posits some laws linking the mental
with the physical without giving us any explanation of them. Following standard scientific
methodology, this is not a theory we should take seriously, just like we shouldn&#8217;t take seriously
Philip Gosse&#8217;s theory about the beginning of the universe. Sometimes we don&#8217;t have direct
empirical evidence for a theory, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that we can&#8217;t decide between it and its
competitor.
<!--l. 113--><p class="indent" >   Most arguments for identity theory appeal to this general intuition. Let&#8217;s see
one more such argument, often called the argument from <span

 id="x1-10001"></a>False representations</h2>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Millikan, like Dretske, Chisholm and Brentano, thinks that what distinguishes the &#8220;directness&#8221; of our
mental states from other kinds of directness is the fact that our mental states can misrepresent how things
are. Like Dretske, she thinks that we can ultimately can explain what is special about our mental states in
completely natural terms, but she disagrees in the details.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   In particular, she offers a damaging observation to Dretske&#8217;s theory: Dretske and others think that
natural representation (as opposed to mental representation) can be achieved by causal means, and
furthermore, that we can come to understand mental representation in terms of natural repre- sentation
under normal circumstances.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   For instance, we can think that a given brain state represents the state of there being a cow because
under normal circumstances it is activated or present whenever its bearer perceives cows. But what are the
normal circumstances? As we saw when we introduced the disjunction problem, it&#8217;s hard to restrict the
class of relevant things. And saying that these circumstances are statistically normal conditions won&#8217;t
help, for to gather such statistics, we would have to know already of the relevant comparison
classes.
<!--l. 41--><p class="indent" >   She thinks that Dretske&#8217;s proposal doesn&#8217;t work. Dretske assimilates having the function of
representing R to being a natural sign of R when the system functions normally, but Millikan
objects:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >Now the production of natural signs is undoubtedly an accidental side effect of normal
     operation  of  many  systems.  From  my  red  face  you  can  tell  that  either  I  have  been
     exerting myself, or I have been in the heat, or I am burned. But the production of an
     accidental side effect, no matter how regular, is not one of a system&#8217;s functions; that
     goes by definition. More damaging, however, it simply is not true that representations
     must carry natural information. Consider the signals with which various animals signal
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     danger. Nature knows that it is better to err on the side of caution, and it is likely that
     many of these signs occur more often in the absence than in the presence of any real
     danger.</div>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >Millikan is making two points: first, that in most cases in which natural signaling occurs, it is a side effect
rather than one of the functions of the signaling element. She gives the example of the red face, but we can
think of others: take our compass. We said that the pointer of the compass indicated the direction of the
north pole because the position of the pointer depends causally on the location of the north pole.
But Millikan would say that the signaling here is just a side effect of the causal interaction
between the metal in the pointer and the magnetic field of the north pole. If we had to talk
about a natural function for the pointer in the compass, we would say that its function is to
interact in such and such ways with magnetic fields, and as a side effect, the pointer is directed
towards the north pole in ordinary circumstances. But, by definition, an accidental feature or side
effect of a system cannot be part of its function, so functions as used by Dretske won&#8217;t help
much.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Her second point is more damaging. Dretske defines the natural function of a given element in a system
in terms of the events that cause that element to appear in ordinary circumstances. Millikan offers a simple
counterexample: suppose that the sound made by a certain animal signals danger. It would be in its best
interest to signal danger more often in the absence than in the presence of real danger, in which case danger
would not cause the signaling in ordinary circumstances. So Dretske&#8217;s account doesn&#8217;t explain how the
sound can signal danger.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   Still, she agrees with Dretske about the appropriateness of the general strategy: she thinks that what
makes something a representation is that it has a certain function. However, she understands this
differently:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >the way to unpack this insight is to focus on representation consumption, rather than
     representation production. It is the devices that use representations which determine
     these to be representations and, at the same time, determine their content. If it really
     is the function of an inner representation to indicate its represented, clearly it is not
     just a natural sign, a sign that you or I looking on might interpret. It must be one that
     functions as a sign or representation for the system itself.</div>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Millikan&#8217;s aim in this paper is to explain why this is the right way to understand representation.
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-20001"></a>Preliminaries: what Millikan means by â&#x0102;Ýnormal&#8217;</h4>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >When Millikan talks about biological functions, she doesn&#8217;t think that biological functions are de-
termined only by origin. It may be, for instance, that a given element in a system is preserved due
to their performance of new functions that they were not selected for. For instance, perhaps
fingers were selected because of their capacity to hold branches of trees or something like that,
but they may acquire new functions later, for instance, the function of handling very small
things, in which case this will also be part of their function. Moreover, the notion of â&#x0102;Ýdesign&#8217;
should be understood in a way that makes room for designs capable of improving themselves or
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
to be altered by experience. For instance, we have good reason to think that our brain is like
this.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Finally, when Millikan talks about normal conditions, she is not thinking about statistically normal
conditions: &#8220;the normal condition for performance of a function is a condition, the presence of which must
be mentioned in giving a flu normal explanation for performance of that function.&#8221; For instance, normal
conditions for discriminating colors are not the same as normal conditions for discriminating smells. Some
functions are only performed rarely or under statistically rare conditions, so the notion of statistical
normality is not the best for our purposes.
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Information producers vs. information consumers</h2>
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s divide a system with intentional states into two aspects: one which produces representations and one
which consumes or uses the representations. For instance, suppose we have some element in the system
that produces natural information in Dretske&#8217;s sense. That information will be useless unless it is
understood by the system, and in particular, unless the consumer part of the system can interpret these
bearers of information adequately. But then, assuming that the understandings of the bearers are
systematically related to the structures of the signs taken to carry some specific piece of information, we
can obtain a set of rules determining the meanings of each of those signs or information carriers. The
meaning of those signs will be whatever allows the consumer part of the system perform its full
function.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Millikan expresses this point as follows:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >      [First,]  the  representation  and  the  represented  [must]  accord  with  one  another,
     so  [by  a  certain  rule]  is  a  normal  condition  for  proper  functioning  of  the  consumer
     device  as  it  reacts  to  the  representation  [...]  The  content  hangs  only  on  there
     being  a  certain  condition  that  would  be  normal  for  performance  of  the  consumer&#8217;s
     functionsâ&#x0102;&#x0164;namely,  that  a  certain  correspondence  relation  hold  between  sign  and
     world. (pp. 502â&#x0102;&#350;503)
     <!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >      Second, represented conditions are conditions that vary, depending on the form of
     the representation, in accordance with specifiable correspondence rules that give the
     semantics for the relevant system of representation.</div>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >She illustrates with two examples. First, beavers splash water with their tails to signal danger. Splashing means
danger for the beaver because the fact that the splash is related to danger is a normal condition for the
fulfillment of the interpretive mechanism&#8217;s function, namely, to interrupt activities and hide. If it wasn&#8217;t the
case that in normal conditions for the fulfillment of the function of self-preservation, splashing was
correlated with danger, then splashing wouldn&#8217;t mean danger.
<!--l. 71--><p class="indent" >   Notice that the account doesn&#8217;t require that there is danger whenever the beaver splashes the water, or
even that there is danger in most such cases. It suffices that the splashes are correlated with danger often
enough.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   Millikan examines an example to show how her approach is superior to others. There are some species
of bacteria in the northern hemisphere for which oxygen-rich water is toxic. They run away from that water
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
by attending to their magnetosomes, tiny magnets that pull towards the north. The function of the
magnetosomes seems to be to make the bacterium move into oxygen-free water, and similarly, we would
like to think that the pull of the magnetosome represents the location of oxygen-free water. Clearly, what
causes the magnetosome to pull one way rather than other is the magnetic field of the north
pole, and it is indeed a function of the magnetosome to signal the north pole, so according to
Dretske&#8217;s account, the pull of the magnetosome signals the north pole, which is the wrong
result.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   Can Millikan&#8217;s view do better? She thinks it does. The reason that the pull of the magnetosome
represents the location of oxygen-free water rather than the north pole is that only the correlation between
oxygen-free water and the pull of the magnetosome will allow the consumer part of the system perform its
proper function: to move away from the oxygen-rich water. If there was no such relation, the consumer part
would not be able to perform that function.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   As Millikan points out, the same sort of representational state may represent different things in different
systems, which seems to be an advantage. To a frog, a black point in the retina may represent food, but to a
bug that same black point may represent a potential mate. Similarly, many different things may represent
the same thing for a single system.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Of course, individual beliefs may not have proper functions like the ones required by Millikan&#8217;s
account, and whatever represents in our brains the claims of economics and computer science can&#8217;t be
thought to have been evolutionarily selected. Millikan&#8217;s reply is that it is the whole brain that gets selected,
and it has the mechanisms to learn. We can institute the picture of proper functioning even for the things we
learn, in pretty much the way advocated by Dretske.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Millikan presents some replies to putative objections, but we won&#8217;t examine them. Instead, we will
examine more general objections to teleological accounts of intentionality.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50003.1"></a>Causal indeterminacy</h4>
<!--l. 85--><p class="noindent" >Fodor and others raise the following kind of objection: evolutionary selection processes are not fine-
grained enough to track meaning or other intentional things. Consider, for instance, the following case:
frogs snap at anything that is small, dark, and moves in order to feed themselves. Presumably, this
mechanism is adaptive and was selected because it was good at getting frogs to feed themselves. However,
let&#8217;s suppose that the only thing that frogs eat are flies, all of which happen to be small, dark things that
move.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   What should we say that the state represents? Should we say that the frog&#8217;s state represents flies, or that
it represents small, dark things that move? In other words, the objection is that causal relations are not
fine-grained enough to account for our seemingly determinate contents. Perhaps it doesn&#8217;t matter to the
frog whether flies are different from small, dark things, but these kind of fine-grained distinctions matter to
us. We often make distinctions between two different properties that have the same causal profiles, and
indeed it seems to be part of the defining characteristics of our mental states that they can do such fine
grained distinctions.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   As we saw, Dretske answers this objection by appealing to counterfactuals, and Millikan
appeals to the notion of normal conditions and proper functions. Do their replies succeed?
Recall that Dretske and Millikan&#8217;s aim is to naturalize intentionality: to give a scientifically
respectable account of intentionality, in terms that don&#8217;t appeal to non-physical or non natural
things.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   Appealing to counterfactuals in this context might seem suspicious. For one thing, we may always ask:
what is the physical fact that makes a counterfactual judgment true or false? Whether counterfactuals have
physical verifiers is not very clear, but let&#8217;s suppose that they do. In this case, Dretske hasn&#8217;t offered a full
account of intentionality yet, for he only offers an account in terms of causal relations, yet he
accepts that it is only causal relations plus some counterfactual truths that constitute a complete
account. He has yet to offer an account of the natural features that make those counterfactual
truths.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   On the other hand, many people have seen the notion of a proper function as suspect. For instance, it
may seem like we can&#8217;t define the notion of a proper function without the notion of a normal condition. But
the way that Millikan understands normal conditions is by reference to the notion of a proper function. This
is blatantly circular, but perhaps we could escape the circularity by defining either notion independently.
How this is to be done is not very clear.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-60003.2"></a>Swampman</h4>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >Donald Davidson invites us to imagine the following case. Out of nowhere, by some freak quantum
accident, a being appears that happens to be an exact physical replica of, say, Davidson at the time. It
undergoes exactly the same physical and chemical processes at that time, but there is no historical relation
between that being&#8212;call it swamp man&#8212;and Davidson. Swampman has no history before it
appeared.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Given that Swampman undergoes exactly the same brain processes as Davidson, it would seem that
whatever mental description is true of Davidson is also true of the swampman. However, if the teleological
theories we have seen so far are correct, this would not be the case. Swampman&#8217;s brain and brain states
were not selected by any process whatsoever&#8212;whether natural or unnatural&#8212;and neither do they have
functions or proper functions in the biological sense. Those functions are defined historically, but
Swampman has no history before the moment of its appearance. If teleological theories of intentionality
were true, then we could not accurately describe Swampman as having the same mental states as Davidson,
but this doesn&#8217;t seem to be the right result.

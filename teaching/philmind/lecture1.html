 id="x1-10001"></a>The questions</h2>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Humans have minds, but rocks, pencils and underwear don&#8217;t (perhaps luckily). At the same time, mentality
seems to come in different degrees of complexity. For instance, cats and dogs seem to have
minds, but their minds are presumably much less complex than our own: they can&#8217;t formulate
thoughts about mathematics, for instance, and for all we know, they are not capable of linguistic
understanding.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   The main task of Philosophy of Mind is to give an account of the nature of the mental. We approach the
issue by asking certain kinds of interesting questions:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">What does it take for something to have mentality? That is, in what circumstances can we
     attribute something mental properties like being in pain, believing or desiring something?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What is it to be in a particular kind of mental state? For instance, what is it to be in pain, to
     have a belief, or to perceive something?
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">What  is  the  relationship  between  the  mental  and  the  physical?  Mental  properties  seem
     radically different from physical properties, as some philosophers have emphasized. So how
     can the physical and the mental interact? Moreover, some people think that there are only
     physical  things  and  properties,  so  that  whatever  mental  properties  are,  they  have  to  be
     reducible  to  physical  properties.  But  if  mental  and  physical  properties  seem  so  different,
     how could the reduction be possible in the first place? How can the mental interact with the
     physical?</li></ul>
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   When we&#8217;re doing philosophy of mind, we&#8217;re not trying to tackle a question about the specific
mechanisms by which beliefs are generated, or the process from a beam of light striking your retina to
conscious awareness. Those are very important questions, but they are better addressed by science. Part of
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
what we are trying to find out is whether a scientific explanation of mentality can be given, and if so, how.
This may be initially hard to understand, but as you read more philosophy, you will come to understand the
kind of explanations that we&#8217;re after.

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >There are different kinds of mental phenomena. In this course we will focus on two:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Intentional states:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Mental   states   that   are   <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">about   </span>something.   For   instance:   beliefs,   desires,
     knowledge, etc.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Phenomenal states:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Mental phenomena that involve sensations, or a certain way it is like to have
     them. For instance, if you look at a sunflower, there is a way it looks like to you: it looks
     yellow, and this way of looking is part of your visual experience. When you bite a peach,
     there is also a certain way it feels like: sweet, perhaps a bit sour, a certain kind of raw feeling.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Basic metaphysical notions</h2>
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Substance:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Some people may define a substance as something that can exist independently of other
     things. For instance: chairs, tables, people, and particles are substances. Shadows, smiles,
     laps, and hallucinations, are not substances. A quick, perhaps defeasible, test to see whether
     something is a substance is this: if we can conceive of a possible situation in which only <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x</span>
     exists, then <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>is a substance; otherwise, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>is not a substance.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-3001f1"></a>
     For instance, we can conceive a situation in which only a chair existed, or one in which only
     a particle existed, but we can&#8217;t conceive of a situation in which only a smile existed.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Properties:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Properties are qualities that substances can have. For instance, my mom&#8217;s cat has the
     property of being spotted, and right now you have the property of reading the lecture notes.
     When  we  want  to  say  that  something  has  a  given  property,  we  often  say  that  that  thing
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">instantiates </span>the property, or that it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exemplifies </span>the property. In general, we will use the variable
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">F </span>for properties, as a way of talking about an arbitrary property.<br 
class="newline" />Not only substances can have properties. For instance, philosophers often think that properties
     themselves can have properties: for instance, the property of being red has the property of
     being  instantiated&#8212;this  is  so  because  there  is  at  least  one  thing  which  is  red.  Properties
     like <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">redness, having a belief, experiencing pain</span>, etc., are usually called first-order properties.
     Properties of properties are usually called second order properties, but for now we can only
     worry about the first order properties.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Relations:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Presumably, you are in New York as you read these notes. That means that you stand in
     a certain property with the city of New York. This is the relation of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being in</span>. You may stand in
     this relation to other places, like Chicago, Boston, or Mexico City. You may stand in different
     relations to different objects.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">States, events, processes:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Think of a computer. At the very least, it has two states: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">on </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">off</span>. We
     can see the passing from one state to another as an event. For instance, when you turn on your
     computer, there is an event of your computer chaging from the state OFF to the state ON. We
     can see a process as a series of states and events that are causally connected. For instance, the
     process starting with your computer being OFF, its change of state and the final state ON is
     a process. In most cases, the states, events and processes that we care about are much more
     complex than this, but you get the idea.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Ontology:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Ontology tries to answer the question what exists. There are two uses of the expression
     &#8216;Ontology&#8217;. One is as the study of what exists, or what there is. The other is as a special
     commitment of a theory as to what exists. For instance, we say things like this &#8220;Contemporary
     physics is committed to an ontology of particles&#8221;, or we say that physics has particles in its
     ontology. What we mean is that if the sentences that constitute physical theory are true, then
     particles must exist (roughly). In this course, we commit ourselves to an ontology including
     substances, properties, states, events and processes, but which substances, properties, etc. in
     particular we should be committed to is a matter of controversy. Hopefully, by the end of the
     course you will have made up your mind as to what ontological commitments you want to
     take on board when it comes to the nature of the mental.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Supervenience:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">A  supervenes  on  B  if  and  only  if  there  can  be  no  difference  with  respect  to
     A without a difference with respect to B. Equivalently: A supervenes on B just in case if
     everything remains the same with respect to B, then it also remains the same with respect to
     A.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Some philosophers think it&#8217;s a mistake to talk about minds as if they were substances. Instead, some of
these philosophers prefer to talk about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">mentality </span>as a more general phenomenon. Something is said to
have mentality if it has at least some mental property&#8212;for instance, if it has some beliefs,
conscious experiences, or any other kind of mental state. Thus, for these people, having a mind is
not like having an iron pan or a punching bag. Rather, having a mind is more like having a
property.

 id="x1-50003.1"></a>Physicalism</h4>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >Physicalists are usually described as thinking that all entities that exist are either things recognized by
fundamental Physics, or reducible to things that are so recognized. One way to understand the
relevant notion of reduction is by means of one of the supervenience thesis we presented above.
Physicalists want to claim that all the mental properties a given object may have are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysically</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">determined </span>by the physical properties it has&#8212;though as we&#8217;ll see in a bit there are many possible
formulations of physicalism, and which one is the best and most satisfying formulation is a matter of
controversy.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn2x0" id="fn2x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-5001f2"></a>
At the very least, our generic formulation of supervenience is a claim that every physicalist is committed to.
Here are some more substantive formulations of physicalism, all of which accept some version of the
mind-body supervenience:

     juicy mango. Unfortunately, this doesn&#8217;t seem like a good candicenter for a mark of the mental,
     since we seem to have direct knowledge of some physical facts. For instance, you seem to

sense to desire those things, but it doesn&#8217;t make sense to kick, pull or eat something that doesn&#8217;t exist. What

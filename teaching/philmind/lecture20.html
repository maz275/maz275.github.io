<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Churchland offers a very clear formulation of his view, which I quote here:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Eliminative materialism is the thesis that our commonsense conception of psychological
     phenomena constitutes a radically false theory, a theory so fundamentally defective that
     both  the  principles  and  the  ontology  of  that  theory  will  eventually  displaced,  rather
     than  smoothly  reduced,  by  completed  neuroscience.  Our  mutual  understanding  and
     even our introspection may then be reconstituted within the conceptual framework of
     completed  neuroscience,  a  theory  we  may  expect  to  be  more  powerful  by  far  than

     <!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >Now let&#8217;s compare this with the kind of expressions and generalizations of folk psychology. Recall
     that folk psychology uses the following kinds of expressions &#8216;... believes that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p</span>&#8217;, &#8216;... wishes that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">q</span>&#8217;,
     and the like:
          <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       a&#8217;. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Once we substitute the variable <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p </span>with a proposition, we get a particular predicate that
          states a relation between an object and that proposition.
          </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
       b&#8217;. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The argument place in the predicates of folk psychology is open to quantification. This
          allows for the expression of generalizations concerning the law-like relations holding
          between objects and proppositions. For instance, for all <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x,p</span>, if <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>fears that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p</span>, then <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x</span>
          desires that <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-109">¬</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p</span>.</dd></dl>
     </dd></dl>
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >These similarities strongly suggest that folk psychology is a theory.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Once we assume that folk psychology is a theory, we can take a new perspective on the mind-body
problem. The answer to the mind-body problem depends on how the ontology of folk theory (the kind of
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
entities it is committed to) is related to the ontology of completed neuroscience. Identity theory predicts
that folk psychology is completely reducible to neuroscience. Dualism rejects this, and the functionalist
also rejects this, if only because she thinks that the phenomena characterized by folk psychology is an
abstract organization of functional states.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   The eliminative materialist also thinks that there won&#8217;t be a reduction from folk psychology to
neuroscience, but for different reasons. He thinks that folk psychology is radically inadequate, it is just too
defective as a theory to survive reduction to neuroscience. He thinks that folk psychology will ultimately be
displaced.

 id="x1-30003"></a>Why folk psychology could turn out to be false.</h2>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >One of the main ways of evaluating a theory is by assessing its degree of coherence and continuity with
well-established theories in related domains. In the case of folk psychology, we should evaluate how well it
coheres with evolutionary theory, biology or neuroscience, for instance.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Churchland tries to make a case that, if we subject folk psychology to the normal standards that we use
to evaluate other theories, it&#8217;s very likely that it won&#8217;t meet them:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (a) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Folk  psychology  has  no  good  explanation  of  phenomena  that  should  be  in  its  domain  of
     enquiry:  mental  illness,  creativity,  intelligence,  sleep,  perceptual  illusions,  memory,  and
     language  acquisition,  have  escaped  the  grasp  of  folk  psychology.  Failures  on  such  scale
     suggest that folk psychology is, at best, a superficial theory of a deeper and complex reality.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (b) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Folk psychology has not made any significant advances in a very long time. Instead, some
     phenomena previously taken to be in its domain are now recognized to belong to the domain
     of other sciences. For instance, we no longer explain rain or bad weather in intentional terms.
     Churchland claims that FP hasn&#8217;t advanced in more than two thousand years, and this is too
     long a period of infertility, given that it has failed to account for so many phenomena in its
     domain. This gives us good reason to think that it lacks the conceptual resources required to
     give a better explanation.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (c) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Folk psychology fares very poorly when it comes to theoretical integration. We can tell a
     coherent story about humans from the perspective of natural history and the physical sciences.
     We can give a story encompassing a large number of disciplines that mesh well together.
     However, the concepts of folk psychology don&#8217;t seem to be part of this growing synthesis.
     Intentional categories are not part of our best psychological and neuroscientific explanations
     of  human  behavior.  Though  this  may  not  rule  out  reduction,  the  stagnation  and  lack  of
     explanatory power of folk psychology make things look less promising.</dd></dl>

<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-50004"></a>The normativity of folk psychology</h4>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Folk psychology is a characterization of an ideal mode of internal activity. It describes what it is to be
rational in the administration of beliefs and desires. Normative theories are not the kinds of things that can
be substituted by scientific theories. Even as a descriptive theory, it is useful to understand our actions as
rational except for the times when some physical malfunction occurs. Such defects are best explained by
empirical theories.
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-60004"></a>Response</h4>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >The fact that folk psychology ascribes the relevant regularities only to ideal agents doesn&#8217;t mean it is a
normative, rather than an empirical theory. Compare with the laws of ideal gas, which are not usually taken
to be normative in any interesting sense. The normative dimension enters because we value most of the
patters ascribed by folk psychology.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Moreover, folk psychology gives us a very minimal and superficial notion of rationality. Finally, it&#8217;s
not clear that folk psychology gives us a good account of cognitive virtue. folk psychology
postulates propositions and propositional attitudes, seemingly modeled on the ways in which we use
language. But language is a relatively new evolutionary development, so it is mysterious how it
can explain more basic kinds of cognitive virtue: capacity to make good inferences, learning,
etc.
<!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-70004"></a>The abstract nature of folk psychology</h4>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Folk psychology attempts to describe our internal states in ways that don&#8217;t make any reference to their
physical constitution. Because of the real possibility of multiple realizability, we can&#8217;t eliminate the
functional charcterization that folk psychology makes possible in favor of any particular theory about
physical substrates.
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-80004"></a>Response</h4>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Churchland points out that in a lot of cases, assuming that the objects postulated by a certain theory are
functionally defined may not save the theory from elimination. Compare modern chemistry with alchemy.
Alchemy posited four different basic things with certain features that, when combined, gave raise to all the
features of material things. One reason why alchemy was eliminated was the simplicity and
explanatory efficacy of modern chemistry. Another reason had to do with grain: alchemy just seemed
to count too many things on the same category, but chemistry showed that the categories of
alchemy were not fine-grained enough to capture the nature of the phenomena it attempted to
explain.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   However, alchemist could have become functionalists: they could have said that the four basic elements
in their theory were not meant to stand in a one-one correspondence with their physical implementation, but
rather, that they were functionally defined. They could have added that chemistry fails to capture the kind
of abstract organization that alchemy captures, and the multiple realizability of their four basic
categories.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   Of course, we should reject this line of response in the case of alchemy, and so, Churchland claims, we
should reject this line of response in the case of folk psychology. Crucially, though, eliminative materialism
is not committed to the rejection of functional theories.

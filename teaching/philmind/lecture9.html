 id="x1-10001"></a>The view</h2>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Lewis believes that mental states can be identified with some physical state or other. In this, Lewis can be
seen as an identity theorist, who claims that every mental state is a physical state. In this, he seemingly
defends the same view as Smart or Feigl. However, his argumentative strategy is very different. Smart
argued for identity theory partly on the basis of the theoretical parsimony of identity theory vs. the
complexity of dualism.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Lewis, on the other hand, claims that we don&#8217;t need to appeal to simplicity in order to discover
theoretical identifications (e.g. that water is H<span 
class="ptmr8t-x-x-80">2</span>O or that pain is stimulation of C-fibers). Instead, such
identifications <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">follow </span>from the meaning of the terms by which we refer to the things to be identified,
together with some empirical facts. We&#8217;ll examine the reasons why he thinks this is the case. In order to do
this, we must first explain his account of theoretical terms.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   His general argument is this:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1 </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Mental state M = the occupant of causal role R (by definition of M)
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2 </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Neural state N = the occupant of causal role R (by the physiological theory); therefore,
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3 </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Mental state M = neural state N (by the transitivity of =)</dd></dl>

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >In a paper called &#8220;How to define theoretical terms&#8221;, Lewis introduces a way of defining
theoretical terms that uses only logical vocabulary and terms that we understood beforehand.
Theoretical terms are simply terms introduced by a theory that were not in our vocabulary
before. If we call our theory <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">T</span>, we may call the terms introduced by it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">T-terms</span>. We can call
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">O-terms </span>the terms in the vocabulary that preceded the introduction of the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">T-terms</span>. The only
requirement on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">T-terms </span>is that they be names. There is no requirement on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">O-terms</span>,
except for the fact that we must grasp them independently of the recently introduced theoretical
terms.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a>
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   The first step to define the T-terms is to write T in a way that exhibits the occurrences of
T- terms in it: <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">T </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">,...,t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">n</span></sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">)</span>, where &#8216;<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub>&#8217;, ..., &#8216;<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">n</span></sub>&#8217; are T-terms. Given this enunciation of T, we
now substitute free variables for all the T-terms. Thus, we get what Lewis call the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">realization</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">formula </span>of T: <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">T </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">,...,x</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">n</span></sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">)</span>. Note that the realization formula of T contains only O-terms and free
variables.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   Keeping the interpretation of the O-terms fixed, any n-tuple that satisfies the realization formula of T
will be said to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">realize </span>T, or to be a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">realization </span>of T. Lewis makes a case for adopting the following meaning
postulates:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If there is a unique n-tuple that realizes T, then the T-terms name, respecitvely, the components
     of that n-tuple.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If there is more than one realization of T, then the T-terms name nothing.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If there is no realization of T, then the T-terms name nothing.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >With the meaning postulates in place, we can determine the denotation of each term introduced by the theory:
the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">i</span>th T-term will denote the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">i</span>th member of the n-tuple that uniquely realizes T, if T has a unique
realization, and will name nothing otherwise. Thus,
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub> </dt><dd 
class="description">= the first member of the unique n-tuple that realizes T
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">2</span></sub> </dt><dd 
class="description">= the second member of the unique n-tuple that realizes T</dd></dl>
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >And so on for the rest of the T-terms.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   At some points, it will be easier to refer to the denotations of the T-terms as the entities
that play or realize a certain <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causal (or functional) role </span>in the unique realization of T. By a
causal role I mean the property of standing in such and such causal relations to other things,
properties, classes, et cetera, as determined by T. For instance, T determines a causal role for
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub>. Such causal role can be obtained by taking all the sentences of T in which &#8216;<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-80">1</span></sub>&#8217; occurs and
substituting free variables for them. The property expressed by the resulting open sentence is a causal
role.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   We can talk about the role that T assigns to <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">i</span></sub> as the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">i</span></sub>-role. Instead of the definitions for the T-terms
used above, we may say that <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">i</span></sub> is the member of the unique realization of T that realizes the <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><sub><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-80">i</span></sub> role. Note
that a functional role is not the same as the thing that realizes the role: playing a functional role is a
property of the property that realizes the role.
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   According to Lewis&#8217;s method, the terms introduced by theories that don&#8217;t have a unique realization are
denotationless. This may be the right result for theories that we take to be hopeless, like the theory of
phlogiston. But there are theories that, though unrealized, are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">nearly </span>realized. That is, there is a unique
n-tuple of entities that realizes a weaker version of the theory, even though it doesn&#8217;t realize the original
theory.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   In these cases, we would like to say that the terms introduced by T denote the elements of the
nearest realization of T, as long as this realization comes close enough to realizing the original
theory.
<!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >   Here is a simple example. Suppose that &#8216;pain&#8217; was introduced by the following pain-theory:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >(T) For any x, if x suffers tissue damage and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is normally alert</span>, x <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is in pain</span>; if x is awake,
     x tends to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">normally alert</span>; if x <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is in pain</span>, x winces and groans and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">goes into a state</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of distress</span>; and if x is not <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">normally alert </span>or x is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in a state of distress</span>, x tends to make
     more typing errors. (Kim, p. 170)</div>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >The theoretical terms introduced by this pain theory are in italics. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Can you define these terms using
the Ramsey-Lewis method? What would the definitions look like?
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Identifying mental and physical states</h4>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >It&#8217;s easy to see how, once we adopt this method for defining theoretical terms, we may explain our
discovery that the entities denoted by the T-terms are the same as the entities denoted by some other
terms&#8212;including old terms and terms introduced by some theory other than T. All we need to find out is
that the entities that we purport to identify with the denotations of the T-terms satisfy the descriptions that
we used to define each of those terms, respectively.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   Here&#8217;s a brief example on how to define &#8216;gene&#8217; using this method. Merely for illustrative purposes, let&#8217;s
suppose that Mendel&#8217;s original genetic theory introduced only one new term, &#8216;gene&#8217;. Let&#8217;s further suppose
that Mendel&#8217;s theory just says that genes are passed from one generation to the next and determine
hereditary traits according to the laws of segregation and independent assortment. Let&#8217;s introduce the term
&#8216;genehood&#8217; to denote the property of being a gene, and modify the theory accordingly&#8212;thus
getting the sentence that all the things which have genehood are such and such. Following
Lewis&#8217;s method, we substitute free variables for the occurrences of &#8216;genehood&#8217;. In this case, we
get the following open formula: all the things that have <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>are passed from one generation to
the next and determine hereditary traits according to the law of segregation and the law of
independent assortment. Since the theory introduces only one new term, we can define &#8216;genehood&#8217; as
follows:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
 </dt><dd 
class="description">Genehood = the unique property had only by the things that are passed from one generation to
     the next and determine hereditary traits according to the laws of segregation and independent
     assortment.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >According to Lewis, if there is no unique such property, the term &#8216;genehood&#8217; names nothing. However, there
may be a unique property that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">nearly realizes </span>Mendel&#8217;s theory. For instance, perhaps nothing realizes
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
Mendel&#8217;s original theory formulated in terms of the laws of segregation and independent assortment, but his
theory entails the weaker theory that all the things that have genehood are passed from one
generation to the next and determine hereditary traits&#8212;no mention of Mendel&#8217;s laws in this
case.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   If there is a unique property that realizes the weaker theory, then the term &#8216;genehood&#8217; denotes
that property. In this case, &#8216;genehood&#8217; denotes the property had only by the things that are
passed from one generation to the next and determine hereditary traits. How can we discover the
physical property that genes are identical to? Well, we may discover that the property of being a
sequence of nucleic acids of a certain kind is the unique property had only by the things that are
passed from one generation to the next and determine hereditary traits. This is all we need in
order to discover that genehood is the property of being a sequence of nucleic acids of that
kind.

 id="x1-40003"></a>Varieties of functionalism</h2>
<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >If we follow Lewis&#8217;s method to the letter, we&#8217;re going to need to say which theory we are using
to define mental terms. Here, two alternatives have been salient in the literature. The first is
the one advocated by Lewis, usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">folk </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">commonsense </span>functionalism. The other is
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">psychofunctionalism</span>:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Commonsense-functionalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">In our common use of mental terms, we are committed to a certain
     theory  about  mental  states.  The  theory  is  supposed  to  be  an  a  priori  theory,  made  up  of
     platitudes that everyone competent in the use of mental terms is supposed to recognize as true.
     Lewis puts it this way: &#8220;Think of common-sense psychology as a term-introducing scientific
     theory, though one invented long before there was any such institution as professional science.
     Collect  all  the  platitudes  you  can  think  of  regarding  the  causal  relations  of  mental  states,
     sensory stimuli, and motor responses." The result should be a theory that we can use to define
     mental terms.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Psychofunctionalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The theory with which we should define mental terms is an a posteriori
     theory, which we only learn as a result of scientific investigation of how our minds work (the
     sort of investigation they do in cognitive science labs).</dd></dl>
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   Using Lewis&#8217;s method for defining theoretical terms, there are two further choices, which we&#8217;ll
illustrate with the mental state of being in pain:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Role functionalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">According to role functionalists, being in pain is having a property that has the
     higher-order property of satisfying the pain-role&#8212;as defined by some psychological theory.
     Thus, something can be in pain as long as it has a property that realizes the pain-role, whether
     it be stimulation of C-fibers (for humans) or inflammation of M-nodes (for martians).
     </dd><dt class="description">
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Realizer functionalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">According to realizer functionalists, being in pain is having the property
     that realizes the pain-role&#8212;again, as defined by some psychological theory. For instance, if
     what realizes the pain-role in humans is stimulation of C-fibers, then being in pain is to have
     stimulation of C-fibers.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s important to notice a characteristic of Lewis&#8217;s version of functionalism: he claims that whatever
plays the roles determined by folk psychology must be unique. This seems to block the possibility of
multiple realization. One way of doing this is by weakening our definitions of mental terms: instead of
saying that pain, say, is the first member of the unique n-tuple that realizes T, we might say that
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">something is in pain </span>if it has the property that plays the pain-role in one of the realizations of
T.

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s focus on the first premise: everything I can conceive clearly, distinctly, and without contradiction, is
possible.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   In general, to say that something is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">necessary </span>is to say that that thing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">must </span>be the case. To say that
something is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">possible </span>is to say that it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">could </span>be the case. Finally, to say that something is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contingent </span>is to say
that it&#8217;s neither necessarily true nor necessarily false. Necessity and possibility are usually taken to be inter
definable: to say that something is necessary is to say that it&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">not </span>possible for that thing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">not </span>to
obtain.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   In English, there are different things we can be saying when we talk about possibility and necessity. We
will describe three of these in what follows:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Metaphysical possibility/necessity:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">When we say that something is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysically </span>possible, we
     are talking about the ways in which things could be. For instance, I have black hair, but it is
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysically possible </span>that my hair was a different color: if <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">things had been different</span>, for
     instance, if my genes were slightly different, the color of my hair could have been different
     too. Again, we use possibility in the metaphysical sense when we want to describe <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">ways things</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">could be.</span>
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Epistemic possibility/necessity:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">When  we  say  that  something  is  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">epistemically  </span>possible,  we  are
     talking about what could be the case <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">for all we know</span>, or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">for all we believe</span>. For instance, for
     all I know, it&#8217;s possible that my friend&#8217;s turtle is alive and happy. Note that something can be
     metaphysically possible without it being epistemically possible: it is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysically </span>possible
     that I was born in Mars, but I know that I was born in planet Earth, so it&#8217;s not <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">epistemically</span>
     possible that I was born in Mars.<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Is there anything that is epistemically possible but not metaphysically possible? Yes: supposed
     that, unbeknownst to me, the person called &#8216;Sarah&#8217; and the person called &#8216;Jen&#8217; are one and
     the same person. Since I don&#8217;t know this, it seems it&#8217;s epistemically possible (for me) that
     Sarah is not Jen. But since Sarah and Jen are actually the same person, it&#8217;s not metaphysically
     possible that they are different people!<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >We should be careful here: it&#8217;s one thing for it to be possible that there are two different
     people, one called &#8216;Sarah&#8217; and the other called &#8216;Jen&#8217;. It&#8217;s a completely different thing to say
     that Sarah could be someone other than herself. The first is possible; the latter is impossible.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Physical possibility/necessity:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">We  defined  epistemic  possibility  and  necessity  by  using  the
     expression <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">for all I know</span>. We can define other kinds of possibility and necessity in similar
     ways. For instance, we can define <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physical </span>possibility as that which is possible <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">given the laws</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of physics</span>. Thus, everything that is compatible with the laws of physics that actually hold
     is said to be <span

class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysically</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">possible</span>. For instance, that the law of inertia fails.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   With these distinctions in place, we should be in a better position to evaluate Descartes&#8217; argument. First
of all, we need to find out which kind of necessity he must be talking about in order for his argument to be
valid. Can he be talking about epistemic or physical possibility? No: his first premise clearly doesn&#8217;t hold if
we&#8217;re talking about physical possibility, and the step from 5 to 6 doesn&#8217;t hold if we&#8217;re talking about
epistemic possibility.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   When Descartes talks about possibility in his argument, he is talking about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">metaphysical possibility</span>.
Having made this clarification, does his argument hold? Some philosophers have denied that the first
premise holds, even when we&#8217;re just talking about metaphysical possibility. This is illustrated by the
example of Sarah and Jen above. However, other philosophers have replied to this attack by saying that the
premise establishes a link between <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">conceiving things in the right way </span>and possibility. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>what could
be this <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">right way </span>of conceiving things, and how could we distinguish it from the wrong way of conceiving
things?
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   For the time being, let&#8217;s examine the merits of Descartes&#8217; own version of dualism.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Descartes&#8217; dualism</h2>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Descartes&#8217; view about the nature of the mind is usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">substance dualism</span>. It is so called because
it posits two kinds of substances: mental and material&#8212;or physical, as we would now call
them.<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-2001f1"></a>
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Descartes&#8217; dualism attempts to recover the common sense intuition that our minds interact with
our bodies: our mind can control our body at will, and our body can influence our minds by
producing in it pains, hunger, and other sensations including sense perception. For this reason,
Descartes&#8217; view is also a version of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">interactionist dualism</span>. The main tenet of interactionist
dualism is simply that, though the mind and the body are different kinds of substances, they can
interact with each other. The following remarks by Descartes show his commitment to this
view:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >      There is nothing that my own nature teaches more vividly than that I have a body,
     and that when I fell pain there is something wrong with the body, and that when I am
     hungry or thirsty the body needs food and drink, and so on. So I should not doubt that
     there is some truth in this (p. 56).<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 72--><p class="indent" >      I am not merely present in my body as a sailor is present in a ship, but ... I am very
     closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If
     this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the
     body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor
     perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken. (p. 56)</div>
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   Descartes&#8217; view was forcefully attacked since the very beginning, which is why we will consider some
objections raised by Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Elisabeth&#8217;s challenges</h2>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >Recall Descartes&#8217; working definition of a body:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >By a body I understand whatever has a determinable shape and a definable location and
     can occupy a spas: in such a way as to exclude any other body; it can be perceived by
     touch, sight, hearing, taste or smell, and can be moved in various ways, not by itself but
     by whatever else comes into contact with it. (p. 17)</div>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, Descartes has argued that he (his soul, his mind) can exist without a body, and without having any
extension. This is what puzzles Elisabeth:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >Given that the soul of a human being is only a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">thinking </span>substance, how can it affect the
     bodily spirits, in order to bring about voluntary actions? The question arises because
     it seems that how a thing moves depends solely on (i) how much it is pushed, (ii) the
     manner in which it is pushed, or (iii) the surface-texture and shape of the thing that
     pushes it. The first two of those require <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contact </span>between the two things, and the third
     requires  that  the  causally  active  thing  be  extended.  Your  notion  of  the  soul  entirely
     excludes extension, and it appears to me that an immaterial thing can&#8217;t possibly <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">touch</span>
     anything else. (Elisabeth to Descartes, 6.V.1643)</div>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >Descartes has claimed that the mind and the body causally interact with each other, and Elisabeth is asking for
an explanation of how the interaction is supposed to obtain. Elisabeth challenges is as follows: causing a
material thing to move requires being extended, but Descartes claims that minds are not extended. So how
can minds cause bodies to move?
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   In another letter, Elisabeth presses the challenge:
        <div class="quotation">
     <!--l. 90--><p class="indent" >      I&#8217;ve never been able to conceive of &#8216;what is immaterial&#8217; in any way except as the
     bare  negative  &#8216;what  is  not  material&#8217;,  and  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">that  </span>can&#8217;t  enter  into  causal  relations  with
     matter!<br 
class="newline" />
     <!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >      I have to say that I would find it easier to concede matter and extension to the soul
     than to concede that an immaterial thing could move and be moved by a body. On the
     one side, if the soul moves the body through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">information</span>, the spirits would have to
     think, and you say that nothing of a bodily thing thinks. On the other side, you show
     in your <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Meditations </span>that the body could move the soul, and yet it is hard to understand
     that [...] a soul that can exist without the body, and that has nothing in common with
     the body, is so governed by it. (Elisabeth to Descartes 10.VI.1643)</div>

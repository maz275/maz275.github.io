<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Antiphysicalists have the intuition that phenomenal concepts&#8212;the conceptions we have of phenomenal
qualities or qualia&#8212;neither a priori imply nor are a priori entailed by physical or functional concepts. This
is the intuition raised by the kind of examples offered by Jackson. Antiphysicalists attempt to use this
intuition to show that phenomenal properties must be different from physical properties. Loar accepts the
intuition that phenomenal concepts are irreducible, but denies that this entails that phenomenal properties

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >So if the antiphysicalist wants to use the version of the argument that doesn&#8217;t beg the question, she must use
some additional premise. What might that premise be?
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   We may start by noting that the descriptions involved in the acquired information are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contingent</span>. Let&#8217;s
assume that the concept of alcohol is something like &#8220;ingredient of wine and beer that makes you feel
intoxicated&#8221; and that the concept of gold is something like &#8220;the stuff that causes this visual experience&#8221;.
But it is only a contingent property of gold that it causes such and such visual experience, and only a
contingent property of alcohol that it makes you feel intoxicated.
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   Contrast this with the properties involved in the knowledge argument. The property of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">feeling that way</span>
that we attribute to a particular visual experience is supposed to be essential to the visual experience. It&#8217;s
not like someone could have had the same visual experience and felt it in a different way. What could have
happened is that someone had seen the same object and had a different visual experience, but this need not
worry us.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   Defenders of the knowledge argument may claim that it is because Mary&#8217;s new knowledge is not just of
a contingent property of the visual experience that the knowledge argument goes through. Loar states this
premise thus:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Semantic premise:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">A statement of property identity that links conceptually independent concepts
     is true only if at least one concept picks out the property it refers to by connoting a contingent
     property of that property.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Loar&#8217;s aim is to offer an account of concepts that doesn&#8217;t require us to accept the semantic premise, and so, that
renders the knowledge argument ineffectual. In other words, he will try to show that a phenomenal concept
can pick out a physical property directly (not via a contingent property of the physical property), and still
be conceptually independent of physical concepts.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Most of his points rely on defending the view he presents from possible objections.
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Recognitional concepts</h2>
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >There are two parts to Loar&#8217;s account of how phenomenal concepts may pick or refer to physical properties.
The first explains how phenomenal concepts <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">directly refer </span>to whatever properties they refer
to. The second explains why phenomenal concepts are conceptually irreducible to physical
concepts.
<!--l. 73--><p class="indent" >   First, Loar claims that phenomenal concepts are &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">type-demonstratives </span>that derive their reference from a
first-person perspective: &#8216;that type of sensation&#8217;, &#8216;that feature of visual experience&#8217;.&#8221; (p. 295) If phenomenal
concepts really are type demonstratives, this would partially give us reason to explain why they directly
refer.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   What is a demonstrative? Demonstratives are referential expressions like &#8216;that&#8217;, &#8216;this&#8217; and the like. On
some accounts of these terms, it is not required to appeal to any particular property in order to account for
their reference, unlike with other expressions such as definite descriptions.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Suppose you are in a supermarket looking at different fruits and you say &#8220;That looks good&#8221;, an
utterance you accompany by a demonstration with your finger. Some philosophers would say
that the expression &#8216;that&#8217;, as you used it, refers to a particular fruit&#8212;a peach, let&#8217;s suppose.
Moreover, it does so without any need to appeal to a particular property that individuates the
fruit.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   Compare with the case in which you say &#8220;The peach on the upper left corner that is touching a pear
looks good&#8221;. In this case, some philosophers would say that you referred to exactly the same fruit as before,
only this time by means of a definite description. This time, they would say, the reference was not direct.
Instead, it was achieved by means of identifying the fruit that had the properties described by the definite
description. In this case, the definite description referred to that particular peach because that peach was
the only thing in the context that was a peach, was in the relevant corner and was touching a
pear.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Some people think that when someone refers to something by <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">description</span>, as in the second case, and
moreover, when the description appeals to essential properties of the object, then unless the two
descriptions are conceptually the same or reducible to each other, one is committed to the claim that the
objects so referred are different.
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   In a way, Loar doesn&#8217;t attack this claim. Instead, he thinks it&#8217;s not relevant to the issue at hand, since
phenomenal concepts refer to phenomenal properties (which, he thinks, are themselves physical properties)
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">directly</span>, we don&#8217;t need to care about the properties used to refer, or whether they are contingent or
essential. We just don&#8217;t use any properties in order to refer!
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   The second part of his account consists in explaining why phenomenal concepts are irreducible to
physical concepts, in a way compatible with the claim that phenomenal concepts directly refer. Loar claims
that phenomenal concepts are of the kind we may call <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">recognitional</span>.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   In general, recognitional concepts are the kind that we learn by how the referred things look, sound,
etc. For instance, some philosophers think that color concepts are recognitional: it&#8217;s not like
we have some sort of description of the color that we then use to categorize things by color.
For instance, it&#8217;s not like we have a description of yellow and then we go out and see which
objects satisfy the description. Instead, we recognize yellow things because they look a particular
way. We also recognize shapes because of how they look, or pieces of music because of how it
sounds.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Recognitional concepts and theoretical concepts are in general independent from each other. The
reason, Loar thinks, is something like this:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Concepts of the two sorts have quite different conceptual roles [...] Basic recognitional
     abilities   do   not   depend   on   or   get   triggered   by   conscious   scientific   analysis.
     If  phenomenal  concepts  reflect  basic  recognitions  of  internal  physical-functional
     states,  they  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">should  </span>be  conceptually  independent  of  theoretical  physical-functional
     descriptions. That is what you expect quite apart from issues concerning physicalism</div>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >If phenomenal concepts are recognitional concepts, this would allow us to explain why they are irreducible
to physical concepts. If they are direct demonstratives, they would allow us to explain how
they could refer to physical things even though they are conceptually irreducible to physical
concepts.
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Closing the explanatory gap</h2>
<!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >Usually, we find out which identity statements are true by means of something like an a priori procedure.
How, for instance, may we identify liquidity with a particular physical property? We start with the
assumption that there is a certain functional characterization of the concept of liquidity. Then we show that
some physical theory gives that particular role to a certain physical property. Discovering that physical
property is an empirical process, but the reduction itself is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">a priori</span>: the identity between a given physical
property and the property of liquidity is entailed by the definition of liquidity in conjunction with the
physical theory in question.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   Unfortunately, if phenomenal concepts are irreducible to physical concepts, this strategy is not
available. The strategy requires at least that the phenomenal concepts be functionally described, but it
doesn&#8217;t look like we can do this with phenomenal concepts.
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   Instead of trying to solve the problem, Loar attempts to explain why this explanatory gap shouldn&#8217;t
worry us. One of the virtues of his account, he says, is that it can explain why there is an explanatory gap in
a way that is compatible with physicalism:
        <div class="quotation">
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >      [T]he  idea  that  phenomenal  concepts  are  recognitional  concepts  of  a  certain
     sort  does  account  for  the  explanatory  gap  in  a  way  compatible  with  physicalism.
     Phenomenal concepts, as we have seen, do not conceive their reference via contingent
     modes of presentation. And so they can be counted as conceiving phenomenal qualities
     directly.
     <!--l. 104--><p class="indent" >      What generates the problem is not appreciating that there can be two conceptually
     independent  &#8220;direct  grasps&#8221;  of  a  single  essence,  that  is,  grasping  it  demonstratively
     by  experiencing  it,  and  grasping  it  in  theoretical  terms.  The  illusion  is  of  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">expected</span>
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">transparency</span>: a direct grasp of a property ought to reveal how it is internally constituted,
     and if it is not revealed as physically constituted, then it is not so. The mistake is the
     thought that a direct grasp of essence ought to be a transparent grasp, and it is a natural
     enough expectation. (p. 305)</div>

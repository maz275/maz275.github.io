 id="x1-10001"></a>A crash course in conceptual-role semantics</h2>
<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps the most widespread view about the content of mental states is that there is something, say, a
proposition, that they have as their content, and this content represents something or other. We have
already seen some attempts to reduce that content to biological functions, but this is not the only
kind of reduction that has been attempted, and indeed the reduction need not be a naturalistic
one.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Some people think that what determines the content of a state or expression is the conceptual role it
plays. This kind of view is usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">conceptual role semantics</span>. It may also be properly called
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">inferentialism</span>, since the conceptual role of a given item is supposed to be given by the kind of role it plays
in certain set of inferences.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   The easiest way of presenting this view is by explaining how this way of determining content applies to
something as simple as logical constants. Logical constants are expressions of logic like &#8216;and&#8217;, &#8216;or&#8217; or &#8216;not&#8217;.
In these cases, it seems easy to define them in terms of the roles they play. For instance, there are two rules
of inference that fully characterize the inferential behavior of &#8216;and&#8217;. These are the rules for introducing it
and the rules for eliminating it:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-109">and</span><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">-introduction:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">From premises <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p</span>, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">q</span>, infer <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">p and q</span>.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-109">and</span><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">-elimination:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">From premise <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">p and q</span>, infer <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">p</span>; from premise <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">p and q</span>, infer <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">q</span>.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >The idea is that the meaning (or semantic content) of &#8216;and&#8217; is whatever satisfies these two rules of inference.
Similar definitions can be given for the rest of the logical connectives.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   Inferentialism as we will understand it concerns the content of mental states. In general, for an attitude
to have as its content a particular proposition just is for it to play a particular role in cognition, and to grasp
that conceptual content is to be prepared to make certain inferential transitions. For instance, for someone
to grasp the proposition that something is a vixen is for that person to be disposed to infer, whenever she
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
thinks that x is a vixen, that x is a mammal, or that x is a female fox, and so on. This might remind you of
functionalism, but our discussion now is purely about content, and not about mental states in
general.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Not all inferentialists are naturalists. For instance, Brandom thinks that the roles that determine the
content of beliefs are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">normative roles</span>; in particular, the roles that determine content are something like
rules that one must obey if he is to be able to communicate with other people.
<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Brandom&#8217;s assumptions</h2>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Brandom wants to distinguish between two kinds of mental qualities. The first, which he thinks we
share with animals, is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">sentience</span>: a kind of awareness in the sense of being awake. Sentience
doesn&#8217;t amount to the reliable responses we have when we encounter certain objects, since such
dispositions could be had by plants or thermostats, but we wouldn&#8217;t attribute mentality to the
latter.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   The second mental quality is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">sapience</span>, which concerns understanding or intelligence:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >One is treating something as sapient insofar as one explains its behavior by attributing to
     it intentional states such as belief and desire and constituting <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">reasons </span>for that behavior.
     Sapients act as though reasons matter to them. They are rational agents in the sense
     that their behavior can be made intelligible, at least sometimes, by attributing to them
     the capacity to make practical inferences concerning how to get what they want, and
     theoretical inferences concerning what follows from what. (p. 509)</div>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >In addition to this feature, things with sapience are the kinds of things that can believe, act, desire, and have
other mental states whose contents can be true or false.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Like most people, Brandom believes that the content of beliefs, desires and the like is a proposition.
Propositions are also the things we denote by means of &#8216;that&#8217; clauses. However, unlike most philosophers,
Brandom things that there are two independent things a proposition does: first, say something, and second
be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">about </span>something. It is only the latter that he takes to be a properly representational dimension of
propositions and thoughts.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   Given that he thinks that saying something, and that thing being about something, are different features,
he must explain how it is that these two sides of content interact with each other. In particular, he wants to
explain why it is that any state or utterance with propositional content also has representational content. His
answers will be along the following lines: a state or utterance manage to represent because of the role
it plays in the assessment of how these states or utterances can serve as reasons in a social
context.
<!--l. 63--><p class="indent" >   Unlike other philosophers, Brandom doesn&#8217;t take the notion of truth as the main notion in terms of
which he will explain representation. Instead, he takes the notion of an inference, and define the things that
have propositional contents as the things that can serve as a premise or a conclusion in an inference. He will
define truth as whatever is preserved by good inferences.
<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   Roughly, Brandom&#8217;s idea is that beliefs have the propositional content that they actually have because
of the role they play in inferences and, in turn in the explanation of our behavior as rational agents. In the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
case of assertions, they owe their propositional content to the role they play in &#8220;the game of giving and
receiving reasons&#8221;.
<!--l. 67--><p class="indent" >   Brandom thinks that there is some sort of normativity to representationality. He thinks
that in having a belief or making an assertion, one incurs a certain commitment, and one is
entitled to making such commitment (and thus to make the assertion) to the extent that he or
she is capable of justifying them. This need not worry us too much, so it&#8217;s ok if it&#8217;s not very
clear.
<!--l. 69--><p class="indent" >   To understand the content of a sentence or a thought is to know which kind of commitments one would
incur by having the thought, and what would entitle one to have those commitments. Brandom uses his
metaphor of scorekeeping in a game to make this point.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Carrying out the inferentialist program</h2>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Brandom only says this in passing, but he doesn&#8217;t really think that there are beliefs. He only thinks that
there are belief ascriptions. He also doesn&#8217;t think that the notion of representation carves very deep. So
what he does is to explain the function of the locutions that we would ordinarily take to indicate what a
particular proposition represents.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   In particular, he thinks that de re ascriptions of propositional attitudes are the prime explicitly
representational locution of natural language. They explicitly state what a proposition is about. Let&#8217;s start
by distinguishing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>from <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de dicto </span>ascriptions of attitudes.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Consider the following two sentences:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (1) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Arya believes <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">that </span>the inventor of the zipper did not invent the zipper.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (2) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Arya believes <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">of  </span>the inventor of the zipper that he did not invent the zipper.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >If (1) is true, it would seem that Arya is an irrational person, but if (2) is true, she might just have the mistaken
belief that the particular person who in fact invented the zipper, didn&#8217;t invent the zipper. We say
that (1) is a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de dicto </span>(from what is said) attitude ascription, and that (2) is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>(about the
thing).
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   In general, we can distinguish de re from de dicto readings of an attitude ascription by the fact that,
in de re ascriptions, we can substitute coreferential terms salva veritate. We have seen that
people like Chisholm and Brentano take intensional inexistence to be the distinguishing mark
of the mental, so in some sense de existence of de re attitudes seems to be at odds with their
claim. Still, it&#8217;s not clear whether or not the existence of these attitudes falsifies Brentano&#8217;s
thesis.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   Brandom stresses the importance of accounting for de re ascriptions:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >What are we <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">doing </span>when we make claims about what someone is talking or thinking
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">about</span>? How must vocabulary be used in order for it to deserve to count as expressing
     such <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>ascriptions? Answering that question in a way that does not itself employ
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     representational vocabulary in specifying that use is then a way of coming to understand
     representational relations in nonrepresentational terms.</div>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Keep in mind that we should understand discursive practice in terms of the adoption of practical attitudes by
which interlocutors keep score on each other&#8217;s commitments.
<!--l. 92--><p class="indent" >   Brandom distinguishes between two different ways of undertaking a commitment&#8212;undertaking a
commitment, by the way, allows others to attribute the commitment. One may acknowledge a commitment
by being disposed to avow it by an overt assertion. Another way to acknowledge a commitment is by
employing it as a premise in one&#8217;s reasoning.
<!--l. 94--><p class="indent" >   The second way of undertaking a commitment is consequential, as Brandom puts it. One undertakes a
commitment consequentially if the commitment is a conclusion one is committed to as a consequence
entailed by the commitments one acknowledges.
<!--l. 96--><p class="indent" >   Brandom thinks that the function of expressions like &#8216;of&#8217;, or what we would ordinarily take to be
descriptions of what something represents, is to aid in communication. He explains this by giving what he
takes to be the conceptual role of these expressions in belief ascriptions.
<!--l. 98--><p class="indent" >   He starts by distinguishing two roles that a given expression can play in a belief ascription: it can be the
explicit attribution of a commitment to the subject of the ascription, or it can express a commitment on the
side of the person who is attributing the belief. Brandom illustrates with the following case. Consider the
following conversation between a prosecutor and his opponent:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (3) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The defense attorney believes a pathological liar is a trustworthy witness
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (4) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Not so; what I believe is that the man who just testified is a trustworthy witness.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (5) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Exactly, and I have presented evidence that ought to convince anyone that the man who just
     testified is a pathological liar.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 104--><p class="noindent" >The disagreement is clearly whether a particular person is a liar, not whether a liar is a trustworthy witness.
Compare (3) with
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (6) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The defense attorney claims of a pathological liar that he is a trustworthy witness.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 108--><p class="noindent" >Brandom claims that
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >the expressive function of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">de re </span>ascriptions of propositional attitude is to make explicit
     which aspects of what is said express commitments that are being attributed and which
     express commitments that are undertaken.</div>
<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >So how should we characterize the functional role of de re ascriptions?
     <div class="quote">
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >Suppose   that   according   to   A&#8217;s   scorekeeping   commitments,   B   acknowledges
     commitment  to  the  claim  <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">&#x03A6;(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">)</span>.  Then  A  can  make  this  attribution  of  commitment
     explicit  in  the  form  of  a  claim  by  saying  &#8216;B  claims  that  <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">&#x03A6;(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">t</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">)</span>.  If  in  addition  A
     acknowledges  commitment  to  the  identity  t=t&#8217;,  then  whether  or  not  A  takes  it  that
     B  would  acknowledge  that  commitment,  A  can  also  characterize  the  content  of  the
     commitment ascribed to B by saying &#8216;B claims of t&#8217; that <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-109">&#x03A6; </span>(it). Again, the question
     is  whose  substitutional  commitments  one  is  permitted  to  appeal  to  in  specifying
     the  consequence  someone  is  committed  to  by  acknowledging  a  particular  doxastic
     commitment. (p. 517)</div>
<!--l. 117--><p class="indent" >   What is expressed by de re specifications of the contents of beliefs is crucial for communication.
For it is only if I am ready to infer something from your characterization of a given thing that
I can be said to understand it. &#8220;Extracting information from the remarks of others requires
grasping what is expressed when one offers de re characterizations of the contents of their
beliefs... It is to grasp the representational content of their claims. The point I have been making
is that doing this is just mastering the social dimension of their inferential articulation." (p.
518)

<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Recall <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Identity Theory</span>, which said that to have a certain mental state <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">m </span>is just to have a certain brain state <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">b</span>.
Putnam (in &#8220;The nature of mental states") and others point out that this view has some important
difficulties.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   We may start with the observation that defenders of identity theory usually claim that the physical states
that mental states are to be identified with are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physical-chemical </span>states. As Putnam observes, this seems too
strong. Here&#8217;s why:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >He  [the  identity  theorist]  has  to  specify  a  physical-chemical  state  such  that  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">any</span>
     organism (not just a mammal) is in pain if and only if (a) it possesses a brain of a
     suitable physical-chemical structure; and (b) its brain is in that physical-chemical state.
     This  means  that  the  physical-chemical  state  in  question  must  be  a  possible  state  of
     a mammalian brain, a reptilian brain, a mollusk&#8217;s brain (octopuses are mollusk, and
     certainly feel pain), etc. At the same time, it must <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">not </span>be a possible (physically possible)
     state of the brain of any physically possible creature that cannot feel pain. (p. 77)</div>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Putnam is calling our attention to the apparent fact that such condition is very hard to satisfy: if we found aliens
that behaved exactly like us, and yelled &#8216;ouch!&#8217; every time we pinch them with needles, but are made of
goo, identity theory tells us that they wouldn&#8217;t feel pain.
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   We don&#8217;t even need to go that far. Octopuses presumably feel pain, but their nervous systems seem to be very different
from our own!<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="#fn1x0" id="fn1x0-bk"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x1-1001f1"></a>
According to identity theory, if octopuses don&#8217;t have the physical-chemical kind of states that bring about
pain in humans, that means they don&#8217;t experience pain.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   But remember that identity theory is a general view about the nature of all mental states, not only pain.
So, according to identity theory, unless something has the kind of physical-chemical states that bring about
beliefs, desires, or even hunger in us (humans), it won&#8217;t have beliefs, desires, or hunger. This sounds like a
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
bad consequence for the friends of identity theory.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   This kind of objection is usually known as the argument from <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">multiple realizability</span>. We can define what
it is for a state to be multiply realizable as follows:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Multiple-realizability:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">A property <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">P </span>is multiply-realizable just in case it can be instantiated by
     different things in virtue of their having different properties.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >For instance, the property of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being in pain </span>is multiply realizable because it can be instantiated in humans in
virtue of the stimulation of C-fibers, in octopuses in virtue of the stimulation of O-fibers, in
martians in virtue of the inflammation of M-nodes, et cetera. Because pain is multiply realizable,
there need not be any particular physical property that everything must have in order to be in
pain.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Most people believe that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">mental states are multiply realizable</span>. It is because this thesis&#8212;the thesis that
mental states are multiply realizable&#8212; is highly plausible that they came to formulate theories like
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">Functionalism</span>, which we will examine now. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>Is behaviorism with the claim that mental states are
multiply realizable?
<!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Functionalism</h2>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >We can generally describe functionalism as follows:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Functionalism:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Mental states are constituted by their causal role; that is, by their causal relations
     to other mental states, as well as their relations to inputs and outputs.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >What does this mean? Let&#8217;s take a look at some things that we can identify by the roles they play. For instance,
a water pump: anything that can move a fluid from one place to another in certain ways is a water pump. Or
think of a piston: the job of a piston is to transfer the energy in a cylinder to a crankshaft by making a
certain movement. Pistons are usually made out of metal, but at least in principle, there could be
pistons made out of wood, plastic, or even rock (though perhaps all these pistons wouldn&#8217;t last
long).
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   What makes a piston a piston is not the material of which it is made, but the role that it plays in the
functioning of certain kinds of engines. Notice that in our characterization of a piston above, we didn&#8217;t only
describe the movements that it makes. Instead, we described the relations that it has to other parts of the
engine, like the cylinder or the crankshaft.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   The idea of functionalism is that mental states can be defined in very much the way we defined a piston:
by describing their functional roles in a given system. For instance, here is a very simplistic functional
characterization of pain: being in pain is being in a state produced by sitting on a tack, that itself produces
the state of being annoyed and the output of yelling &#8216;ouch!&#8217; <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: How is this different from</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">behaviorism?</span>
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   Over the course of the years, different philosophers have offered different methods for functionally
characterizing a mental state&#8212;though note that these methods can be used to give functional
characterizations of anything whatsoever! Because of its historical influence and because it was the earliest
formal characterization, we will take a look at functional characterizations of mental states in terms of
machine states.

find in a machine table, and no more. For instance, a description of the machine characterized by the table
above would say that the machine has four states, such that if the machine is in one of them (start) and it
receives input 1, then it will remain in the same state and move to the right, if the machine is in another of
them (A), and receives input 1, then it will remain in the same state and move to the right, and so
on.

no room for chance: whenever the machine is in a given state and receives a certain input, it
will determinately do a certain thing. Instead of doing this, we could have merely assigned a
probability that the machine does a certain thing if it receives a certain input and is in a certain
state.
<!--l. 130--><p class="indent" >   For instance, we could have said that if the machine receives input 1 and is in state Start, then it will
print 1 with a probability of .7 or print 0 with a probability of .3, it will remain in state Start with a
probability of .6, or change to A with probability .3, or change to B with probability .1, and so on. The sum
of the probabilities of the alternatives must always be 1!
<!--l. 132--><p class="indent" >   So when Putnam says that all organisms capable of feeling pain are probabilistic automata, what he
means is that they could be fully described in terms of a description like the one above. Moreover,
only certain descriptions will characterize the kind of things that can feel pain (perhaps a very
simple description won&#8217;t make something capable of feeling pain, but a more complex one
will).
<!--l. 134--><p class="indent" >   Condition 3 merely requires that the object that receives such description is not itself composed by
objects that also receive that kind of description. For instance, if it turned out that a bee hive behaves in the
ways described by the machine table that characterizes pain, and that the bees themselves are
describable in those ways, Putnam doesn&#8217;t want to say that the bee itself is capable of experiencing
pain!

<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Notice that the program characterized by the machine table above can be implemented in many different
ways! It can be carried out by a machine modeled literally after a Turing machine, but it could also be
carried out by a purely mechanical machine (like Babage&#8217;s Analytical Engine). It can even be
carried out by a purely hydraulic machine, or by a machine made out of LEGOs. Thus, at least
in principle, it seems that functionalism can account for the multiple realizability of mental
states.

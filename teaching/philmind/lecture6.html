<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Recall the three different attitudes one could have towards Turing&#8217;s test:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Completely  deny  that  passing  the  Turing  test  guarantees  being  able  to  think  or  being
     intelligent. At best, the Turing test is good for <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">simulating </span>thought and intelligence, not for
     <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">genuinely </span>having thoughts and intelligence.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Think that passing the Turing test gives us good reason to believe that a computer can think
     or is intelligent, but doesn&#8217;t guarantee being intelligent or having thoughts.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Think that passing the Turing test <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">suffices </span>for being intelligent or having thoughts. According
     to  this  response,  being  intelligent  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is  just  </span>to  behave  in  certain  ways.  In  particular,  being
     intelligent <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is just </span>to behave in the ways that something would need to behave in so that it
     passes Turing&#8217;s test.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >We already examined some arguments that people with attitude 1 may have. How about the other two
attitudes?
<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s focus on 2 first. Suppose that the fact that computer C passed Turing&#8217;s test didn&#8217;t even give us
reason to think that C is intelligent or capable of thought. Perhaps, following attitude 1, we think that it only
shows that C can simulate intelligence. Now think about the kind of evidence that you have for thinking
that other <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">people</span>, apart from yourself, are intelligent. Is it substantially different from the kind of evidence
that passing Turing&#8217;s test can give us?
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   When we attribute intelligence and thoughts to other people, all the evidence we have for
this consists in the way they behave. We think that other people are intelligent because of the
way in which they behave: they speak intelligibly, respond to our answers in coherent ways,
and so on. So why should people&#8217;s intelligent-like behavior give us good evidence that they
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">genuinely </span>are intelligent, but reject this for computers? There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any principled
reason.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   Some people, those endorsing attitude 3, take this line of reasoning further. They claim that passing the
Turing test would not only give us good evidence for the passer&#8217;s intelligence. It would <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">guarantee </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">suffice</span>
for the passer&#8217;s intelligence. This is so, they claim, because being intelligent, having thoughts, and so on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">is</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">just  </span>to behave in such and such ways. In particular, being intelligent, having thoughts, and so on,
is just to behave in the ways in which something that passes the Turing test would have to
behave.
<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   People endorsing attitude 3 are usually called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">behaviorists</span>. Sometimes they are called <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">logical</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">behaviorists </span>to distinguish them from the defenders of behaviorist theories in psychology.
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Behaviorism</h2>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s start with some questions. On certain conception of the mind, we have a special kind of access to the
contents of our own minds, but not to the minds of others. For instance, you can know <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">first-hand </span>that you
are in pain, or that you are having a certain thought. Others can&#8217;t know this about you in the same way. In
order for them to know that you are in pain or that you are having a certain thought, they need to look at
what you do. If you say &#8216;ouch&#8217;, then this is good evidence that you are in pain, and if you say
&#8216;I think that roses are red&#8217;, this is good evidence that you are indeed thinking that roses are
red.
<!--l. 54--><p class="indent" >   But what if when I say that I&#8217;m in pain, what I&#8217;m really experiencing is something more like a tickle, or
even pleasure? On the view of the mind described above, it seems possible that I act exactly the same way I
do, yet experience tickles when I claim to experience pains, and the other way around. After all, I can&#8217;t be
sure that my use of the word &#8216;pain&#8217; is wrong, since the only sensations that I can know are my
own!
<!--l. 56--><p class="indent" >   These kinds of considerations worried some people in the past. They thought that the idea that this
was possible attempted against the commonsensical idea that communication is in principle
possible. We are not going to examine this more thoroughly, but we can summarize this in
the form of a perfectly sensible worry: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">if our behavior is to count as evidence of our mental</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">states, then there must be some relation between them</span>&#8212;that is, there must be some relation
between behavior and mental states, that explains why the former gives us good evidence for the
latter.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   Behaviorists think that behavior is good evidence of mentality (and of more particular mental states)
because <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">having a mind is just a matter of exhibiting or having a propensity, capacity or disposition to</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exhibit appropriate patterns of behavior</span>(Cf. Kim, p. 62). So what is behavior?
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s hard to give a definition, but some examples should help: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">physiological reactions and responses</span>,
together with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">bodily movements</span>, count as behavior for our purposes. For instance, an increase
in pulse rate, raise in blood pressure, perspiration, raising a hand, walking, running, uttering
noises, and so on. The crucial feature of these kinds of movements is that we don&#8217;t need any
psychological vocabulary to describe them. Contrast them with events that require some psychological
component, like greeting your friends, calculating, or thinking about what you&#8217;ll do when the class is
over.
<!--l. 62--><p class="indent" >   The crucial feature of behavior is that it&#8217;s <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">public</span>: everyone has equally good access to someone&#8217;s
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
behavior, including the person whose behavior we are studying. Contrast with things like sensations or
beliefs: the experiencer of these sensations or beliefs is supposed to have some special access to them, but
she has no special access to her heart rate, or to the measure of her blood pressure, and even if there is
something it feels like to walk, as long as she is walking, anyone who observes her movements is in as good
a position to know that she is walking.
<!--l. 64--><p class="indent" >   You can start seeing how, if behaviorism is true, it can explain why behavior gives us evidence of
mentality. Since behaviorists reduce mentality to behavior, seeing that someone exhibits a particular
behavior is, in a way, just like seeing that she exhibits mentality.
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   But notice that we are not always behaving in intelligent ways. Sometimes we sleep, and sometimes we
just don&#8217;t exhibit behavior that signals any complex mental states: for instance, when we&#8217;re eating or
yawning. Should we say that we are not intelligent when in those cases? That would be weird! This is why
behaviorists appeal to the notion of a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">disposition</span>. Let&#8217;s define behaviorism in terms of dispositions, and
then define the latter:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Behaviorism (improved):</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">All there is to having some mental state is being <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">disposed </span>to behave in
     certain ways in response to certain kinds of stimuli.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Now we&#8217;ll say something about dispositions.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >
   <h4 class="likesubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-30002"></a>Dispositions</h4>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >Consider properties like being fragile, being crushable, or being soluble. We say that something is fragile if
it is easily broken, and soluble if it can be dissolved in some solvent. But of course, when we say that a
glass is fragile, it doesn&#8217;t <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">have to be </span>already broken, it just has to have a certain propensity to break. In
order for something to be soluble, it doesn&#8217;t have to actually been dissolved, it just has to be such that it
dissolves if a certain condition obtains.
<!--l. 75--><p class="indent" >   One way of refining the notion of a particular disposition is by means of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">counterfactuals</span>, that is,
sentences like the following:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If I had eaten enough at lunch, I wouldn&#8217;t be hungry now.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">If I had unplugged my fan, it would have stopped running.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >The particular counterfactuals above are true, not not all counterfactuals are. For instance, here
is a false counterfactual: if I had woken up earlier today, the Martians would have invaded
us.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   Now let&#8217;s go back to dispositions. One way of defining what it is to be fragile is by appealing to a
counterfactual like this one: something is fragile if and only if it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">would </span>break if struck in certain ways;
something is crushable if it <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">would </span>be crushed, had we applied a certain force to it; something is soluble if it
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">would </span>dissolve if it were placed in water.
<!--l. 84--><p class="indent" >   Notice that in order for a glass to be fragile, it doesn&#8217;t have to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">actually </span>break. For a sugar cube
to be soluble in water, it doesn&#8217;t have to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">actually </span>dissolve. A glass could be fragile if it
never breaks. For instance, I may make a glass so fragile that I worry it would break if even
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
the slightest force struck it, so I put it in a safe box, and it never breaks in its whole history.
Perhaps at some time it is disintegrated, but it never breaks. That doesn&#8217;t make the glass any less
fragile.
<!--l. 86--><p class="indent" >   When people talk about dispositions, they often distinguish between manifestations and categorical
bases:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Manifestation:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">An event of a glass being broken, or of salt being dissolved, are manifestations of
     their fragility and solubility, respectively. Some people call <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">manifestation conditions </span>to the
     conditions that have to obtain in order for a disposition to be manifested&#8212;e.g. for a glass to
     break.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Categorical basis:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">The categorical basis of a disposition is the set of properties in virtue of which
     something  has  the  disposition.  For  instance,  salt  may  be  soluble  because  of  its  molecular
     structure. Even if different things have the same disposition, the categorical basis need not be
     the same for all of them. For instance a glass and a house of cards may both be fragile, but
     their fragility may be based on different categorical bases.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >Now that you know what dispositions are, you are in a better position to understand the formulation of
behaviorism above.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   Very few people these days accept behaviorism, and with good reason. Several philosophers have
criticized on these kinds of grounds:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (i) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">We all think that mental states have <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causal powers</span>: feeling pain may cause us to move our
     hands away from the fire, and beliefs and desires may cause us to act in certain ways. It&#8217;s not
     clear how behaviorism captures this intuition.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  (ii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Some  philosophers  have  offered  the  following  kind  of  thought  experiment:  suppose  that
     someone makes a doll that she can control remotely. She makes the doll behave in exactly the
     same way a human would. Does this mean that the doll has genuine thoughts or mentality?
     Most of us wouldn&#8217;t think so.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
 (iii) </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Can we really reduce every possible mental state to a set of dispositions? Try defining beliefs
     merely in terms of dispositions to action!</dd></dl>
<!--l. 100--><p class="indent" >   We may try to define what a belief is solely in terms of dispositions. For instance, let&#8217;s say that to
believe that p is to have the disposition to utter the sentence &#8216;p&#8217; when asked whether p. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Questions: </span>Do you
think this is a correct definition of belief? why, or why not? Can you think of cases in which the definition
would fail?
<!--l. 102--><p class="indent" >   Further problems come from the fact that different kinds of mental states seem to stand in complex
relations with each other, and this makes it very hard to see how a behavioral definition of the mental
states could be given. For instance, consider the following principle: if a person desires that p
and believes that doing A is an optimal way to secure p, she will do A. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Question: </span>What do
you think about this principle? Is it true? Can you think of any situations that would falsify
it?<span class="footnote-mark"><a

<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Functionalism is the view according to which to be capable of mentality is to have a certain
functional organization. Let&#8217;s use a simple functional definition of the state of being in pain to
illustrate:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >Being in pain = being in a state such that sitting on a tack causes that state and being
     on that state causes anxiety and saying &#8216;ouch&#8217;.</div>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >Using this simple definition, we can make a distinction between a <span

<span

     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span

class="description">A functional role is the property of standing in such and such relations to other
     properties,  states,  etc.,  as  determined  by  a  given  description.  In  the  example  above,  the
     functional role associated with pain is this: the property of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being the state </span>that is caused by
     sitting on a tack and causes anxiety and saying &#8216;ouch&#8217;. Note that the property of being <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">that</span>
     state is not the same as the property of being <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">in that state</span>. A person can be in that state, but it

     stimulation of C-fibers is a state that is caused by sitting on a tack and causes anxiety and

     property that realizes the pain-role. In this case, one of the ways in which one can have the
     property of being in pain is by one&#8217;s C-fibers being stimulated.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 45--><p class="noindent" >We will discuss these definitions more thoroughly when we examine Lewis&#8217;s paper, but it&#8217;s a good idea to get
used to them and keep them in mind. Now let&#8217;s go back to Putnam&#8217;s machine functionalism.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Identifying states</h2>
<!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >On Putnam&#8217;s view, the required functional organization is given by a machine table. Thus, on this kind of
functionalism, to be capable of mentality is to have a functional organization <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">describable </span>by a certain
machine table.
<!--l. 51--><p class="indent" >   With respect to particular mental states, functionalism tells us that to be in a mental state <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">m </span>is to be in a
state that plays the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">m-role</span>, as defined by the appropriate machine table. Note, however, that machine tables
define states in relation to all the other states, inputs and outputs in the table: it doesn&#8217;t make much sense to
ask whether the state called &#8216;A&#8217; in one machine table is the same as the state called &#8216;A&#8217; in a different
machine table. The reason is that states are defined with respect to the rest of the states in a single machine
table.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   But this means that in order for something to be in a particular mental state, it has to have exactly the
structure characterized by a given machine table. So any two things that can have that mental state must
have the same psychology! Kim puts the point nicely:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 55--><p class="noindent" >the machine-functionalist conception of the mind has the following consequence: For
     any two subjects to be in the same mental state, they must realize the same Turing
     machine. But if they realize the same Turing machine, their total psychology must be
     identical. That is, on machine functionalism, two subjects&#8217; total psychology must be
     identical if they are to share even a single psychological state&#8212;or even to give meaning
     to the talk of their being, or not being, in the same psychological state. This sounds
     absurd: It does not seem reasonable to require that for two persons to share a mental
     state&#8212;say,  the  belief  that  snow  is  white&#8212;the  total  set  of  psychological  regularities
     governing their behavior must be exactly identical. (Kim, p. 152)</div>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >So, on one hand, functionalism seems to be compatible with the multiple physical realizability of mental states.
On the other, it seems to require that everyone&#8217;s total psychology be exactly the same. This doesn&#8217;t sound
promising, but perhaps it can be solved by requiring that partial characterizations of mental states be given,
but it&#8217;s unclear whether this can be done.
<!--l. 59--><p class="indent" >   Another problem comes when defining the inputs and outputs for the functional roles of
mental states. Maybe humans say &#8216;ouch&#8217; when they have pain, but octopuses don&#8217;t. So we need
a characterization that is general enough to cover all cases that we are interested in. Again,
it&#8217;s not clear what kind of story we should give about this, and we won&#8217;t go too deep into the
details.
<!--l. 61--><p class="indent" >   These objections can be seen as objections of detail: it is possible that, in the future, we will come out
with a way of refining the theory that solves these problems. However, other people have raised stronger
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
objections to functionalism, or tried to offer arguments that restrict the extent of its success. We&#8217;ll start with
Searle&#8217;s famous <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">chinese room argument</span>. Then we&#8217;ll see Lewis&#8217;s version of functionalism, and see more
important objections by Ned Block.
<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Searle&#8217;s Chinese room argument</h2>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Searle invites us to consider a case like the following:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >There&#8217;s a person in a room who doesn&#8217;t speak chinese, but can distinguish symbols by
     their shape. She is put in a room and given two pieces of paper with chinese symbols in
     it. She is also given a book with instructions (in English) for how to manipulate chinese
     symbols. the book gives her instructions to write, for any combination of symbols in the
     two pieces of paper that she is given, a new combination of symbols in a different piece
     of paper. Every time she gets the papers with the chinese symbols in them, she follows
     the instructions in the books, writes some symbols in a new piece of paper, and gives
     this to someone through a little window. This results in what appear to be the responses
     that a native chinese speaker would give to a series of questions.</div>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >Searle thinks that if functionalism was true, then the person in the room would understand chinese merely by
virtue of following the rules in the book, but he thinks that the person in the room clearly doesn&#8217;t
understand chinese.
<!--l. 78--><p class="indent" >   Notice that the example is not especially directed against a functionalist characterization of
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">understanding chinese</span>. Any other mental state could have helped, as long as we take the instructions in the
book to give a complete functional description of the mental state in question, and the processes executed in
the chinese room are the same functional processes as the ones executed when someone has the relevant
mental state.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   What should we think about this argument? Searle considers a couple of objections and replies, the
most important of which is the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">system reply. </span>According to the system reply, while it might be true that the
person inside the room doesn&#8217;t understand chinese, what matters is that the whole system does; that
is, that the system constituted by the person in the room, the book of instructions, the pieces
of paper, and the processes by which the person manipulates the symbols, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">does </span>understand
chinese.
<!--l. 82--><p class="indent" >   Here is Searle&#8217;s response:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >My response to the systems theory is quite simple: let the individual internalize all of
     these elements of the system. He memorizes the rules in the ledger and the data banks
     of Chinese symbols, and he does all the calculations in his head. The individual then
     incorporates the entire system. There isn&#8217;t anything at all to the system that he does not
     encompass. We can even get rid of the room and suppose he works outdoors. All the
     same, he understands nothing of the Chinese, and a fortiori neither does the system,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     because there isn&#8217;t anything in the system that isn&#8217;t in him. If he doesn&#8217;t understand,
     then there is no way that the system could understand because the system is just a part
     of him.</div>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >Let&#8217;s focus first on one of the things he says: there isn&#8217;t anything in the system that is not in the operator, and
so, Searle says, if the operator doesn&#8217;t understand Chinese, neither does the system. Is this a good
argument?
<!--l. 88--><p class="indent" >   No. Consider the following lines of reasoning:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There isn&#8217;t anything in my heart that is not in me, so if I don&#8217;t weigh five pounds, neither does
     my heart.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There isn&#8217;t anything in the Chinese room that isn&#8217;t in the operator, so if the operator wasn&#8217;t
     designed by a group of programmers, neither was the Chinese room.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >These are all bad arguments, so why should it be good when replying to the systems response?
<!--l. 95--><p class="indent" >   A more important point is the following: just because the operator doesn&#8217;t understand Chinese, that
doesn&#8217;t mean that the system &#8220;inside&#8221; him doesn&#8217;t understand either. Think about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">virtual machines</span>: it is
possible to have a given operative system, say Mac OS, and have it emulate another operative system, say
some version of Linux. Now it is possible that the Linux OS is running a certain program, say Firefox, but
this doesn&#8217;t by itself mean that MacOS is also running Firefox: MacOS may not even have Firefox installed
in it!
<!--l. 97--><p class="indent" >   It may even be that the Linux machine crashes while MacOS, and even the emulator itself, is still
running. Moreover, there is some sense in which Linux is &#8220;inside&#8221; or &#8220;incorporated&#8221; into MacOS, but as
we&#8217;ve seen, this doesn&#8217;t mean that they have to share their states.
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   This is the kind of relation between the operator and the Chinese room inside her head: the fact that the
operator has internalized all the process and instructions doesn&#8217;t mean that the operator must share all of
the Chinese room&#8217;s states. For instance, the Chinese room may believe that China was at its cultural peak
during the Han dynasty, but this doesn&#8217;t entail that the operator must also be in that state, and vice
versa.

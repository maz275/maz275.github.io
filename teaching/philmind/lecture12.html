<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >Yablo thinks that identity theory doesn&#8217;t do any better than epiphenomenalism. True, if identity theory
were correct, and every mental property or event was identical with some physical property or
event, then mental properties would have the same causal powers as the corresponding physical
properties (since they would be exactly the same properties!). Unfortunately, the objection from the
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
multiple realizability of mental properties and events seems to be enough to discard identity
theory.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Moreover, Yablo thinks that not even <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">token </span>mental events are identical to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">token </span>physical events, so we
better explain how mental events can cause physical events.

   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>Determinates and determinables</h2>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Yablo&#8217;s strategy is quite simple: he observes that it follows from premises that most people accept that
some mental and physical properties, events, and so on, stand in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">determinate-determinable </span>relations with
each other. By arguing that when a given property or event is a determinate of another, it doesn&#8217;t preempt
the causal powers of the latter, he argues that mental properties and events <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">can </span>cause physical
properties and events. He further argues for some requirements on cause-effect relations in order to
show that, in most cases where we think that something mental causes something physical, the
mental thing indeed causes the physical thing, but the physical realization of the mental thing
doesn&#8217;t.
<!--l. 53--><p class="indent" >   Let&#8217;s start by explaining the determinate-determinable relation. Some properties are more determinate
than others: for instance, the property of being <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">colored </span>is less determinate than the property of being a
specific color, say, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">red</span>, and this property is less determinate than the property of being a specific shade of
red, say <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">crimson</span>. Being red, yellow or green are specific ways of being <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">colored</span>. Because of this, we say
that being red, being yellow and being green are each a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">determinate </span>of the determinable <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being colored</span>.
Similarly, being crimson, being vermilion and being burgundy are determinates of the determinate <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">red</span>. But of course, being amber and being saffron are not determinates of the determinate <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">red.</span>
<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   Yablo offers a more precise characterization of this relation, which he dubs <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">determination</span>:

     </dd></dl>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >With a sharp notion of determination in place, he is in a position to argue that mental properties and their
physical realizations stand in this relation. That is, he argues that physical events or properties <span

mental events or properties, or that some physical properties and events are determinates of determinable
mental properties and events.

<!--l. 71--><p class="noindent" >But note that this entails that, necessarily, something has a mental property if it has a physical property by
which that mental property is asymmetrically necessitated. But asymmetric entailment amounts to the
relation of determination presented above. So we can replace &#8216;determines&#8217; for &#8216;asymmetrically entails&#8217; in
the claim above. Thus:

<span

class="description">Necessarily, something has a mental property if and only if it has also a physical determination
     of that mental property.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 75--><p class="noindent" >(D) is the standard way of characterizing things that stand in the determinate/determinable relation: something
has a determinable property if and only if it has some determinate that falls under that determinable. A
good explanation of this fact is that the relation between physical and mental properties is a species of
determinate/determinable relation.
<!--l. 77--><p class="indent" >   Knowing this, we are in a position to show that, except we want to claim that determinable
properties have no causal powers whatsoever, mental properties can cause physical properties.
Yablo illustrates with an example like this: suppose we condition a dove to eat a grain of corn
whenever it sees the color red. We show the dove something red, which causes the dove to eat a
grain of corn. But remember that being red is itself only a determinable, and so, it requires a
determinate property to be instantiated. Let&#8217;s say that the thing we show to the dove is crimson. If the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exclusion principle </span>is true and we assume that what causes the dove&#8217;s eating was its seeing
crimson, we can conclude that the determinable property of being red was causally irrelevant to its
eating.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   However, there are numerous cases in which we would like to say of a given determinable that it caused
something. By an application of the exclusion principle in each case, we will end up concluding
that only ultimate determinates (properties that have no determinates themselves) are causally
relevant.
<!--l. 81--><p class="indent" >   Yablo takes things even further. He notes that even when some property causes something
else, it need not be every aspect of the property that intervenes in the cause. For instance, the
property of being crimson has the property of being expressed by &#8216;being crimson&#8217;, but this is
irrelevant to its causing the dove to eat corn. So we can abstract of all the causally irrelevant
properties in the ultimate determinate (let&#8217;s say that, in our example, crimsonness is not itself
further determinable) and leave only the properties that are causally relevant. This will give us a
new <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">determinable </span>which is itself sufficient to cause the dove to eat. But if this is the thing that
causes the dove to it, then even the ultimate determinate can&#8217;t cause the dove to eat. As Yablo
puts it: &#8220;And now it begins to look as though no property ever makes a causal difference.&#8221; (p.
183)
<!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   Thus, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exclusion principle </span>as formulated seems false, but there seems to be some truth to it. Someone
may reformulate it as saying that the competing causes have to be separate, but this need not worry us anymore:
properties standing in the determinate/determinable relation can hardly count as separate. In particular,
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
properties standing in such relation are not causal competitors with each other. Thus, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">exclusion argument </span>is
neutralized.<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x1-40004"></a>Why mental properties can cause</h2>
<!--l. 86--><p class="noindent" >If Yablo is right, so far he has shown that mental properties can be causally relevant compatibly with the
causal sufficiency of their physical bases. But this doesn&#8217;t show that mental properties actually cause
anything. Yablo argues that causes must be commensurate with their effects: they should incorporate a good
amount of causally relevant material without incorporating too much that is not causally relevant. He then
proposes the following constraints on commensurability:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Effects are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">contingent </span>on their causes: if <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">x </span>had not occurred, then <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">y </span>would not have occurred
     either.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Causes  are  <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">adequate  </span>for  their  effects:  if  <span

class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">if  it  had</span>,  <span

     occurred as well.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Causes are <span

     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Causes are <span

<!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >When a putative cause satisfies these conditions, it is said to be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">proportional </span>to the effect. Though
proportionality may not be a necessary condition for causation, it seems reasonable to prefer the more
proportional candicenter whenever trying to decide which of two competing things caused a given
event.

<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >In order to offer a genuine explanation of any given phenomenon, it is not satisfactory to use as
the explanandum (the thing to be explained) as part of the explanans (the thing that does the
explaining). The point is as obvious as saying that if I want to explain why birds fly, it won&#8217;t
do if I just say that they fly because they have a capacity to fly and sometimes they exert that
capacity.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   A lot of philosophers think that trying to explain mental intentionality by appealing to things that
themselves have intentionality is like the bad explanation above. It&#8217;s just like offering the explanandum as
part of the explanans. However, Dretske makes a case that this need not be so. It would be a
bad explanation if we used mental intentionality to explain itself, but it&#8217;s legitimate to explain
mental intentionality in terms of a different kind of intentionality &#8212;we may call it natural
intentionality.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   Dretske makes a case that there is a kind of intentionality that is not exactly like mental
intentionality. If this is so, he thinks, it is legitimate to use it as a part of our explanation of mental
intentionality:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >As long as there is no mystery&#8212;at least not the same mystery&#8212;about how the parts
     work as how the whole is supposed to work, it is perfectly acceptable to use intentional
     ingredients  in  a  recipe  for  thought,  purpose,  and  intelligence.  What  we  are  trying
     to  understand,  after  all,  is  not  intentionality,  per  se,  but  the  mind.  Thought  may  be
     intentional, but that isn&#8217;t the property we are seeking a recipe to understand. As long as
     the intentionality we use is not itself mental, then we are as free to use intentionality in
     our recipe for making a mind [...] (p. 492)</div>
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   Consider a compass. If it functions properly and is in the right circumstances, it indicates the direction
of the north pole. Of course, it doesn&#8217;t indicate the direction of polar bears, even though the north pole and
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
polar bears are in the same direction. If you take a compass and move polar bears around it, this will have
no impact on the pointer in the compass.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   An intensional (with an &#8216;s&#8217;) context is one in which coextensional terms can&#8217;t always be
substituted for one another in a way that preserves truth. We often think that intensionality (with
an &#8216;s&#8217;) is a good guide to intentionality: if our description of a certain state or condition is
intensional, this is good evidence that the state it describes is intentional (it has directedness,
as we&#8217;ve put it before). Given that the compass indicates the direction of the north pole but
not the direction of the polar bears, and that the direction of the polar bears happens to be the
direction of the north pole, it seems that the kind of terms that we use to describe the state of the
compass generate intensional contexts. Thus, these descriptions describe intentional states of the
compass.
<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   Notice that the intentionality of the states of the compass is not derived from other intentional
states. For instance, it&#8217;s not derived from what we know, what we believe, or our explanatory
purposes:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >To  say  that  the  compass  indicates  the  direction  of  the  arctic  pole  is  to  say  that  the
     position of the pointer depends on the whereabouts of the pole. This dependency exists
     whether or not we know it exists, whether or not anyone ever exploits this fact to build
     and use compasses [...] The power of this instrument to indicate north <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">to </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">for us </span>may
     depend on our taking it to be a reliable indicator [...] but its <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">being </span>a reliable indicator
     does not depend on us. (p. 493)</div>
<!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >If this is true, then intentionality is a natural phenomenon, existing in the physical world. The problem is to
explain how this kind of intentionality can be used to produce the intentionality characteristic of mental
phenomena. In particular, how it is that mental phenomena can manage to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">misrepresent.</span>
<!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-20002"></a>What won&#8217;t do</h2>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >Dretske argues that an account of representation appealing only to causation will not do. Consider our
explanation of why the compass indicates the north pole. We could say something like this: the compass
indicates the north pole because the position of its pointer <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">causally </span>depends on the position of the north
pole. The pointer moves one way or the other because the north pole&#8217;s electromagnetic field causes it to
move that way.
<!--l. 58--><p class="indent" >   If we take <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">indication </span>or <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">information </span>to be defined in such causal terms, we can&#8217;t explain how something
may manage to misrepresent. Any event that is caused by C will thereby be an indicator of C. It just doesn&#8217;t
make much sense to say that something can misrepresent something if representation amounts
just to causal dependence. What if there is more than one thing that ordinarily causes <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-109">e</span>, and
how should we make sense of an individual event ordinarily being caused by some thing or
other?
<!--l. 60--><p class="indent" >   This gets us closer to another formulation of the problem of misrepresentation, often called the
disjunction problem for naturalistic theories of mental representation:
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >The problem is one of explaining how, in broadly causal terms, a structure in the head,
     call it R, could represent, say, or mean that something was F even though a great many
     things other than something&#8217;s being F are capable of causing R. How can the occurrence
     of R mean that something is F when something&#8217;s being F is only one of the things
     capable of causing R?</div>
<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Take the compass again. Suppose that there is one very powerful magnet in the same direction as the north
pole, and of course, our compass points in that direction. Each of the magnet and the north pole could be
causally responsible for the pointer&#8217;s position, and in this case, it doesn&#8217;t make a difference to the pointer&#8217;s
position which of the magnet and the north pole are in fact causally responsible, since they are in the same
direction. But what, if anything is the compass indicating? Is it indicating the position of the magnet or the
position of the north pole?
<!--l. 66--><p class="indent" >   It&#8217;s somewhat easy to see how, if we solved this problem, we could solve the problem of
misrepresentation. If we had a way of determining which of the two things the compass is indicating, we
would have a way of explaining why, if we move the magnet in a different direction, the compass would
now <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">misrepresent </span>the direction of the north pole, but would not even attempt to represent the direction of
the magnet.
<!--l. 68--><p class="indent" >   Dretske&#8217;s point so far is that we can understand the disjunction problem and the problem of
misrepresentation as the same problem under different guises. He also makes the further point that, unlike
the basic kind of causal indication we saw above, the kind of misrepresentation that the compass can
achieve can&#8217;t be used in our explanation of mental intentionality.
<!--l. 70--><p class="indent" >   Dretske illustrates with a thermometer and a paper clip. The metal in the thermometer and the clip both
carry information about the local temperature: their volume increases or diminishes with the temperature.
But it only makes sense of the thermometer to say that it could misrepresent the temperature (if, say, there
was something wrong with it). What is the difference?
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >The only relevant difference between thermometers and paper clips is that we have
     given the one volume of mental&#8212;the mercury in the glass tube&#8212;the job of telling us
     about temperature [...] Since it is the thermometer&#8217;s job to provide information about
     temperature, it (we say) misrepresents the temperature when it fails to do its assigned
     job just as (we say) a book or a map might misrepresent the matters about which they
     purport to inform us.</div>
<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >But of course, having the job of telling temperature is not something that the thermometer can do by itself. Its
function is something that we give to it. Now we are closer to finding what we need in our explanation of
thought, or so Dretske thinks.
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >
   <h2 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30003"></a>Natural functions</h2>
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
<!--l. 77--><p class="noindent" >Think about our description of the thermometer above. Dretske thinks that if we could find a way of
specifying representational functions (or jobs) in a way that doesn&#8217;t require our intentions, purposes and
attitudes, we could combine such functions with natural indicators in order to get the kind of intentionality
that characterizes our thoughts. In particular, he thinks that we could solve the problem of
misrepresentation. Why? Because something could indicate something that it&#8217;s not its function to
indicate.
<!--l. 79--><p class="indent" >   He considers two ways in which we could give such a specification, only the second one of which he
thinks will help our purposes:
     <dl class="description"><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Evolution:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Some people think that something like the heart has a natural function: to pump blood.
     It has that function because of its selectional history: the function of a heart is to pump blood
     because hearts were selected for their blood-pumping capabilities. Similarly, we may think,
     our senses have an information-providing function. They were selected for their ability to tell
     the animal in which they occur about its environment.
     </dd><dt class="description">
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-109">Learning:</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">Think of an animal that needs to do A in circumstances C in order to survive. Let&#8217;s suppose that
     this animal can perceive circumstances C, and that when it does so perceive, it has an internal
     element E responsible for this. If the animal is to survive, some of the internal mechanisms in
     the circuit must change so that whenever E is present, the animal performs A. If this
     happens, then E will have acquired the function of informing of C. Dretske puts the point as
     follows:
          <div class="quote">
          <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >The  internal  indicators  must  be  harnessed  to  effector  mechanisms  so  as  to
          coordinate  output  to  the  conditions  they  carry  information  about  [...]  internal
          elements that supply needed information acquire the function of supplying it by
          being drafted into the control loop because they supply it. They are there, doing
          what they are doing, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">because </span>they supply this information.</div>
     </dd></dl>
<!--l. 87--><p class="noindent" >Of these two ways of getting a function, Dretske thinks that only the second one will work. The reason
is that the kind of function determined by evolutionary mechanisms can only produce non
voluntary responses, but Dretske thinks this is not the kind of mechanism that could explain
thought.
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   Instead, he thinks that the kind of mechanism he dubs <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-109">learning </span>is the one responsible for the right kind
of functions. Still, we may wonder whether content defined in terms of this sort of function
can escape the disjunction problem. For instance, let&#8217;s suppose that there is some indicator R
that gets its function of indicating cows only by exposure to Jersey cows. This doesn&#8217;t mean
that R means Jersey cow, or just animal, but then how can we make sure that it means just
COW? Dretske follows Fodor in claiming that it must satisfy the right counterfactuals. For
instance, that if the indicator is presented with a non-Jersey cow, it will still fire or produce the
cow-representation.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   So what&#8217;s Dretske&#8217;s recipe for thought?
                                                                                   
                                                                                   
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 93--><p class="noindent" >Take a system that has a need for the information that F, a system whose survival or
     well-being depends on its doing A in conditions F. Make sure that this system has a
     means of detecting (i.e. an internal element that indicates) the presence of condition F.
     Add a natural process, one capable of conferring on the element that carries information
     F the function of carrying this piece of information. (p. 497)</div>
<!--l. 95--><p class="noindent" >Dretske briefly addresses a final objection: suppose that the indicator indeed has a content; in order
for it to count as a thought, it must also play the functional role of a thought. In particular,
it must be involved in inference and reasoning, and explain behavior. According to Dretske,
the indicators with the appropriate natural functions satisfy these requirements: &#8220;According
to this recipe for thought, nothing can become the thought that F without contributing to a
rational response to F, a response that is appropriate given the system&#8217;s needs or desires.&#8221; (p.
498)
